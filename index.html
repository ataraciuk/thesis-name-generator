        	This introductory class is designed to allow students to engage in a critical dialogue with leaders drawn from the artistic, non-profit and commercial sectors of the new media field, and to learn the value of collaborative projects by undertaking group presentations in response to issues raised by the guest speakers. Interactive media projects and approaches to the design of new media applications are presented weekly; students are thus exposed to both commercial as well as mission-driven applications by the actual designers and creators of these innovative and experimental projects. By way of this process, all first year students, for the first and only time in their ITP experience, are together in one room at one time, and as a community, encounter, and respond to, the challenges posed by the invited guests. The course at once provides an overview of current developments in this emerging field, and asks students to consider many questions about the state of the art. For example, with the new technologies and applications making their way into almost every phase of the economy and rooting themselves in our day to day lives, what can we learn from both the failures and successes? What are the impacts on our society? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space? Class participation, group presentations, and a final paper are required. 		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	The goal of this course is to provide students who are new to the principles of visual design with the practical knowledge, critical skills and confidence to effectively express their ideas in a visually pleasing and effective way. Over the course of 7-weeks an overview of the many tools and techniques available to convey an idea, communicate a message and influence an experience will be presented, discussed and applied. Topics covered in the course include: typography, color, composition, branding, logo and information design. This class is intended for students who do not have formal graphic design or visual arts training but recognize the powerful impact of visual decisions in their work.<br />
 <br />
COURSE OUTLINE<br />
Week 1 – Principles of Visual Communication<br />
Week 2 – Signage and Information Systems<br />
Week 3 – Typography<br />
Week 4 – Composition<br />
Week 5 – Logo and Brand Design<br />
Week 6 – Color Theory<br />
Week 7 – Information Design<br />
<br />
Each week a new topic will be presented. The format will be a class discussion with a focus on examples of the theme for the week. Each topic will have a related assignment that will done by each student individually and presented and critiqued in the following class. For students new to or with limited skills in Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator there will be a series of informal weekly workshops led by residents to teach the basics and answer questions on use of the software. Completion of the assignments and participation in the class discussion is required. Students must maintain a blog where they post their weekly assignments.<br />

        	The web has become one of our most fundamental mediums.  It supports rich interaction between people and machines, people and data, and, most importantly, people and other people. Though the core web interaction is simple, a client sends a request to a server, which replies; services of incredible sophistication and scale have been built around it. In this class, students will learn to lay out and make a page responsive to the user; take user input; and work with a server to receive, store, manipulate, and return that input. Students will use HTML, CSS, the markup languages behind page structure and look; and PHP, a server side programming language.  <br />

        	What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming the computer (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) and then touches on some more advanced techniques such as image processing, computer vision, data parsing and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle for the class. Students with one semester of programming experience, or equivalent, should enroll in Daniel Shiffman's *Tuesday* section (CALL #5411) which will move more quickly through the basics.  All other sections will assume no programming experience at all. The end of the semester is spent developing an idea for a final project and implementing it using computer programming.	<br />

        	This course expands the students' palette for physical interaction design with computational media. We look away from the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface of today's computers, and start instead with the expressive capabilities of the human body. We consider uses of the computer for more than just information retrieval and processing, and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller, a single-chip computer that can fit in your hand. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. Core interaction design concepts include user observation, affordances, and converting physical action into digital information. Students have weekly lab exercises to build skills with the microcontroller and related tools, and longer assignments in which they apply the principles from weekly labs in creative applications. Both individual work and group work is required.		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This class is about how to design products, services, and experiences that dignify the user in their implementation and lead to a true measure of success: long-term engagement and repeat interactions. We work through how to establish and continue relationships between users, taking as our inspiration theory, poetry, prose, and thirteen important online products or services. The class assumes a high level of comfort with non-linear thinking and proficiency in social network interactions, applying that knowledge to product design and implementation. <br />

        	This course will explore recent developments in 3d scanning technology and the tools and techniques for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing 3d data. Once relegated to the realm of academic and military research, 3d scanning has recently been made available to amateurs through DIY implementations like DAVID laser scanner, or, in the case of Kinect, through open source reverse engineering of cheap consumer hardware. We will cover different methods of 3d input, including structured light, LIDAR, time of flight, stereo matching, and optical triangulation -- and focus on techniques for organizing and collecting data, creatively visualizing it, and using it in an interactive context. This course will be taught using openframeworks, a C++ toolkit for creative coding. While the class will be highly technical and code-heavy, there will be a strong emphasis the poetic potential of this new form of input. <br />

        	The environmental and conservation movements have failed us. Despite massive investments in clean tech, popular support of the public, and aggressive political activism, we are still facing unprecedented rates of species extinction, forest loss, and climate change.  Many of the organizations, agencies, and politicians we entrusted to protect the planet are struggling to grasp technology, connect with a new generation of supporters, and modernize their efforts.  At a time when we need these organizations the most, some of them are more concerned about saving themselves than saving the planet and that's not acceptable. How many more oil spills will it take?  How many more acres of the rainforest will we need to see cleared? How many more coral reef systems must be decimated before we say enough? Can we build a new environmental movement before it's too late? What will this new movement look like and how will it work? What tools and technologies can we harness? <br />
<br />
As the co-founder of Project Noah (<a href="http://www.projectnoah.org">www.projectnoah.org</a>), a joint venture with National Geographic (and my ITP thesis project), I have been working for the past 4 years on mobilizing a new generation of wildlife explorers and environmental activists. Leveraging my experience and a large network of artists, activists, tribal leaders, NGO leaders, business people, and educators I've worked with, this class will 1.) briefly cover the history of the conservation and environmental movements, 2.) assess where they currently stand on a global scale, and 3.) explore the possibilities of building more effective versions (with an emphasis on 3). Assignments will range from readings to short presentations. Students will be asked to focus in on a specific environmental or conservation cause to build out their final projects (for example, fighting for indigenous peoples rights or reforesting). Invited guests will provide insights from their work and feedback on final projects. The goal of this class isn't just to start a conversation, but to design and develop the pieces of a new environmental movement. Those pieces can be illustrations, musical compositions, new mobile apps, sensor networks for trees, or whatever. <br />

        	The Maker movement and the rise of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) in education have reignited the interest of hands-on-learning, tinkering and making. People with disabilities can directly benefit from participating in STEM activities at school, home and use these skills to find their passion and possibly a career. Currently, few options are available to make STEM accessible, how will a teenager with cerebral palsy use an Arduino if they can not use their hands? Can a student with visual impairments design a 3D model to printed if they can not see the software? How can the Maker movement include the disability community? This course will explore how the disability community can become active participants and become Makers through the use of accessible tools and methods. We will discuss the current state of assistive technology for people with disabilities and how it overlaps with the Maker movement. We will design and build accessible tools for STEM activities for classroom and home use. The ideal outcome of this course is to support the integration of the disability and Maker communities through identifying challenges and proposing accessible tools, ideas that allow accessible making.		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	Animation is the magic of giving life to objects through motion. Whether in linear storytelling, or in interactive experiences where another sense of wonder is achieved. Together with visual design, motion can be a powerful tool for storytelling, information visualization as well as for compelling interfaces. <br />
<br />
This course is focused on advanced animation techniques and principles, to further add character and expression, to animated objects.<br />
<br />
We learn the differences between linear and real-time, or generative animation, and how we can harness both to create a seamless experience. The discussion includes the integration of such animations, across different kinds of platforms, such as, installation based, web, and mobile. The main tool to be used is Adobe After Effects, and experimentation with code generated animation using processing is also demonstrated and encouraged. This is a production class, with short studies, and two main projects at mid and end term, required. Prerequisite: is ITPG-GT 2002 Comm Lab: Animation or equivalent knowledge in basic animation and video production.		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	From Movable Type to the Internet, our desire to automate the work has been a major driving force behind many technological advancement. Thanks to these technologies, we are living the world that is extremely efficient and scalable, but as a result, we became alienated from the process of making. Often, we find the process humanly impossible to comprehend, due to our lack of sense for such scale or complexity. Yet, many aspects of our life is dictated by these automation processes and as a result, they automate us. <br />
<br />
In this fast-paced studio/theory class, we will discuss various concepts that are loosely related to the theme: the duality inherent in the relationship between technology and design, in the world full of automation. Topics will include: abstraction, mass-consumption, data logging, privacy, persistence, default and power structures, synchronization, pervasiveness, etc. <br />
<br />
Students are expected to explore the topics given each week and create quick and small projects around the idea. Possible projects including, but not limited to: performance, sculpture, interactive installations, and generative art. Students are encouraged to break boundaries. Basic knowledge in creative computing is assumed, and we will be using various prototyping techniques including Processing, HTML/CSS and Javascript, and/or Adobe Creative Suite. <br />
<br />
Weekly lecture will cover relevant readings and works by other artists, followed by casual presentation and discussion. Students will be given opportunity to develop and finalize one of their projects for the final. 		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	While in school students have access to some of the best 3D-printing technology currently available at a very affordable price.  After graduation, however, access to this high-end technology becomes prohibitively expensive.  This course aims to prepare students for life without a "media lab" and will leave them with all the basic knowledge needed to incorporate affordable 3D-printing into their work after graduation.<br />
<br />
Students will become familiar with the hardware and operation of machines like the MakerBot Replicator and learn how to overcome the limitations of these consumer-focused machines. With correct planning, these machines can be used to create and prototype large scale objects which normally would require expensive, commercial equipment.  Weekly assignments will have students creating the various parts needed to assemble a “ robot” of their own design, complete with moveable articulated joints and sculpted details. The aim of this ongoing, light-hearted project will be to teach students all the necessary design tricks needed to create complex structures and objects of any type with a high-grade of finish.  While a familiarity with 3D design will be of help, the course will give students of all disciplines and skill levels, the tools to bring 3D printed objects into their studio practice.		  <br />

        	With their always on and always connected nature, mobile devices (phones and tablets) have become the center of our connected self. They offer us the ability to access the network anywhere at anytime, enabling us to share our experiences and share in the experiences of others. They are also starting to emerge as the hub of an emerging set of smart personal accessories such as watches, glasses and jewelry.	  	<br />
<br />
In this class, we'll examine the current state-of-the art in mobile technology and smart devices.  We’ll focus on developing applications using the Android SDK and various accessory SDKs such as the Glass Development Kit for Google Glass (pending availability) and possibly the Pebble SDK.<br />

        	This class will use animals, humans, and other creatures as a way to think about art-making and character representation . Claude Levi-Strauss’ observation that “Animals are Good to Think” is the starting point from which we will make, discuss, and examine the ways in which art works imagine the interrelationships between the human, the animal, and our environment. If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears.  Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a datascape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This class focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation or data visualization. There will be introductory texts on character development, and generally an emphasis on literary, philosophical and natural history texts.		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This course explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and representation as mediated by technology. We will investigate ways that technology can be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way.<br />
<br />
How do the things we build and use limit and expand the way we understand and relate to each other? We'll explore this question by building new tools and creating new situations for breaking us out of existing patterns, and discussing contextual examples from media art, performance art, psychology and pop culture. Technologies explored will include computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks), data representation and glitch, browser extensionsand plugins (in Chrome), computer security, mobile platforms, and social automation and APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Mechanical Turk).<br />
<br />
Students will develop projects that alter or disrupt social space in an attempt to reveal existing patterns or truths about our experiences and technologies, and possibilities for richer interactions. Different tactics for intervention and performance will be explored, first through a set of short prompts or experiments, and then through a larger, more thorough intervention.<br />

your world to look like? This class will focus on creating the future<br />
by creatively appropriating new technologies.<br />
<br />
The class will cover the history and social context for new<br />
technologies, and discussions about how we adopt them. The primary<br />
tool we'll be using is openFrameworks: a C++ toolkit designed by a<br />
global community of media artists, with an emphasis on real time<br />
interaction. Because it's C++, it provides an easy bridge to a huge<br />
variety of low level tools like OpenCV and FaceTracker -- which makes<br />
it easier to develop otherwise impossible projects, like the<br />
EyeWriter, or to explore cutting-edge ideas like real time face<br />
substitution. In this class, we'll work with technologies surrounding<br />
face tracking, eye tracking, 3d scanning, computer security, privacy,<br />
and sharing. We'll spend a lot of time understanding the intricacies<br />
of openFrameworks, with the goal of creating seamless, mind-blowing<br />
experiments, installations, and performance pieces that hijack new<br />
technologies to create the future we want to see.<br />
<br />
Prerequisites: A conviction that creative people can genuinely derail<br />
society for the best, and the ability to geek out with code when<br />

        	Since antiquity, people have been fascinated with automatically controlling physical movement, light and sound to imbue inanimate objects with lifelike qualities.  This course will explore the concept of automation, its history in the arts and industry and cover techniques for building and controlling automated devices.  <br />
<br />
We will look at historical and literary examples of automata, discuss their technical execution and cultural context, and explore their roles as precursors to sound recording, cinema and interactive media. Technical topics will include designing mechanisms for automating movement, working with various types of motors, solenoids and relays, programming automated routines using microcontrollers and software, and interfacing with popular automation protocols like MIDI and DMX.  Beyond technology, we will try to understand what qualities give autonomous machines a sense of personality and invite users to graft narratives onto them.<br />
<br />
In addition to producing midterm and final projects, students will complete a variety of smaller conceptual and technical studies to help build a toolkit for designing and programming automated systems.  We will also visit one of the world’s largest collections of mechanical musical instruments and automated figures to see functioning historical examples in person.  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Today's mostly digital world also requires a basic knowledge of analog circuits.  In this course students learn about the basic principles of analog circuits design and operation.  Students learn about discrete components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors as well as integrated components such as operational amplifiers.  In addition, students become familiar with the operation of basic electronic test equipment such as digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, function generators.  The instructor lectures on, and demonstrates, basic analog concepts so that students can form a basic rule of thumb understanding of analog circuits, concepts and components.  In the lab, students can integrate analog solutions into their project work.		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

But in a culture driven towards app stores, startups, and dubious lumbering towards something called code literacy do these words still ring true? It's difficult to dismiss the accessibility of Apple's iPad but have we come any closer to Alan Kay's DynaBook? In the New York Review of Books article "The Chess Master and the Computer", Gary Kasparov wrote "Weak human + machine + better process was superior ... to a strong human + machine + inferior process." This could be interpreted as a darkly pessimistic version of Jobs' uplifting words. Or not. By examining critical texts, contemporary practice in pedagogy, art and business, and some forgotten dreams perhaps we can hope to better navigate the whitewater of technological progress.		<br />

        	What happens to games when they escape the boundaries of our tabletops, desktops and living rooms? From massively multiplayer online games to mobile games that turn the city into a gigantic game grid, super-sized gaming opens up new spaces in which to play and seeps into the interstices of our days. Whether these games are measured in terms of number of players, geographical dimensions or temporal scope, they represent a new trend in which the ‘little world” created by a game threatens to swallow up the "real world" in which it is situated.  This class is a hands-on workshop focused on the particular design problems of large-scale games.  In this class students: develop a foundation of basic game design understanding from which to approach the specific issues particular to big games; analyze existing digital and non-digital large-scale games, taking them apart to understand how they work as interactive systems; and work on a series of design exercises that explore the social, technological, and creative possibilities of large-scale games. 		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This class is designed to equip students with basic knowledge of biomechanics and human movement, as well as of sensors that can be used to track, visualize, or measure different aspects of it.  The study of human movement dates back before the days of da Vinci, and readings covered throughout the class will give students an appreciation of the evolution of this field as an art and a science.  Materials covered in class will range from basic anatomy and vocabulary used to talk about motion, limits of human athletic performance, balance, how human joints function and how muscles create movement, human factors in product design, etc.  The lectures will serve as a foundation for a midterm project in designing a system to track, measure, or visualize some aspect of gait, and a more open-ended final project that will deal with exploring human motion through a physical system or expressing understanding of biomechanics through other mediums like video, sound, generative artwork, and more.  Both individual and small group work will be required.  Prerequisite: Intro to Physical Computing		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Biomimetic designs are used both practically and conceptually to provide solutions to a wide range of environmental and technological problems. Designers have developed an assistive arm modeled off of an elephant trunk that moves in three-dimensions to handle things as delicate as eggs; Architects have built houses from organically grown material; And engineers have developed robotic snakes to explore underwater pipelines for leaks and find hidden secrets in the Pyramids of Egypt. <br />
<br />
This 7-week course will take a design-based approach to exploring biomimicry as an inspiration for interactive interfaces.  Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on prototyping, we will investigate how natural forms and functions can inspire unique technological solutions. We'll address topics such as re-imagining social networks, mapping urban spaces, and redesigning user interfaces. We will think critically about natural systems and use it as the starting point for our own design development and prototyping. We will work collaboratively to build prototypes that combine hardware, software, and fabrication. <br />
<br />
We will complete two projects, the final of which will comprise a physical product that integrates bio-inspired design with tangible interfaces. Throughout the course, we will document our work online & offline.Students will be encouraged to use Processing, Arduino, digital fabrication techniques, sensors, and electromechanical actuation.<br />

        	Why is it so hard to care for our planet and ourselves. We seem hungover from a century of prosperity and ingenuity, unable to invent economic models that create jobs, improve health, and restore the earth. Eager ITP students are better equipped than MBAs to envision and hack our way out of this trap, but often lack an understanding of the mega forces of business, regulation, and bad cultural habits that keep us from saving ourselves. But don’t despair! We’ll get busy, and make things again – but also provide you with conceptual scaffolding upon which to build your worldchanging ideas.<br />
<br />
Our tools of understanding include deep design thinking, and systems thinking. By focusing on two systems in particular: human bodies, and the buildings that humans make, we will examine the environmental and social impacts of the economic systems. Bodies are in trouble right now – despite reaching the peak of productivity the US now leads the world in the rampant growth of chronic diseases that lower life expectancy, and reduce life quality. Buildings are not in enough trouble – they account for the largest source of both electricity consumption (68% of global use) and greenhouse gas emissions (48% of global emissions) in the world.<br />
<br />
In this course we will discover what Dana Meadows calls “leverage points” as places to intervene that would transform the system as a whole. <br />
<br />
Areas for investigation include:<br />
<br />
 <br />
Bodies:<br />
<br />
·       Data-driven accountable health care<br />
<br />
·       Behavior as the new wonder drug<br />
<br />
·       Data liquidity and the patient data movement<br />
<br />
·       Mindfulness vs. the quantified self<br />
<br />
 <br />
Buildings:<br />
<br />
·       Spimes  - the internet of things<br />
<br />
·       LEED, passive houses, benchmarking<br />
<br />
·       Failures of the cleantech revolution<br />

        	Building on the skills learned in "Intro to Dataflow Programming" this course will explore the possibilities of real time video compositing and manipulation.  Somewhat different from audio and signal manipulation, video control in Jitter is based around matricies. We will discuss how video works in a matrix, issues around optimization of video formats and live feeds, and how to setup patches that are ready for performance and installation. We will also explore some of the related OpenGL and 3D tools. While the "Intro to Dataflow" course used Pd, we will be working with the Jitter package in Max/MSP. The concepts we will be covering can be applied to other dataflow environments, like Quartz Composer and Gridflow for Pd, though it is not as directly applicable as Pd to Max.  The prerequisite for this two point course, which meets the second seven weeks of the semester, is "Intro to Dataflow Programming", which meets the first seven weeks, (or equivalent experience).	  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	Architectural spaces shape our feelings of intimacy, security and privacy. They can be designed to both  enhance and  confuse our senses. Such experiences were built into the fabric of static spaces such as St. Paul’s Cathedral and The Capitol. The experiences however, are immutable. Technology changes this. Now the artist can create dynamic and context aware narratives for both individuals and groups in a physical space. <br />
<br />
This new space offers unique opportunities and constraints. Discovery, Identity, Time, Memory, Networking, Feedback and Control, to name but a few.  Using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Zigbee for the hardware stack; Google App Engine and Google Cloud Services for the backend, students will  create narrative driven immersive experiences. Each class consists of a lecture  and lab with practical code and hardware examples for  creating their own solutions.  These efforts will culminate in the production of a final project. At the course’s conclusion students will have a toolkit for  storing sensor data, parsing vast datasets, presenting data, and controlling environments on a fully scalable, Enterprise level cloud computing platform. 		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	If you were inventing a museum today, what would it look like? Who would be there? What would its main purpose be?  The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside--amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go; to see things they would never otherwise be able to see. Museums were a great experiment in learning in a public place, a 3D space? How is that different from learning in a classroom? Is learning still a primary goal?  And now there’s television, movies, the internet and travel. Why do people go to museums now? Will they in the future? Today, most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors than they used to. How do people learn in public spaces? How do we know that they do? How can they make use of the new interactive technologies and not lose what’s special about them?  The class is an exploration, observation and theory class with some design mixed in. Museum and exhibit visits are your primary assignments for the first half of the course—usually accompanied by a reading. You will also make some record of your visit (including a sketchbook, a dioramas, reviews) There will be guest speakers from Museums and exhibit design firms, and a few field trips. In the second half of the course, you begin to imagine how you might reinvent a museum and develop a full-scale presentation of your own Cabinet of Wonder.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	How do you change the world when users are being bombarded by messages and asks on all sides on a regular basis? If you are trying to build a movement, grow an audience, or get people to the polls, how do you know where to find people, and how do you get them to take an action that both you and they care about?<br />
<br />
In the digital age, users are increasingly stimulated by different types of media, multiple asks, and requests for their information. Simultaneously, they are providing more information about themselves, about their interests, and about what they don't like. The activity of data collection has skyrocketed to new heights with the advent of the digital age, and the power of the data is manifold: it allows you to understand what a user is likely or unlikely to respond to based on previous actions, it allows you to target individuals in your audience with messages specifically relevant to them, and it enables users to tell you what they actually care about and want more of. <br />
<br />
In this seven week course, students will learn about data collection and analysis in the digital age, as well as determine how and why to develop strategies for both online and offline media based upon data. Taught by Blue State Digital's Sarah Newhall (Executive Vice President and former Director of Analytics), this course will explore the increasing importance of digital data, as well as dive into why on earth, in the post-Obama election world, people get so excited about big data, smart data, and fast data. <br />

        	This two credit course is designed to teach students the design and fabrication of through-hole and surface mount printed circuit boards.  Taking control over the design and fabrication of your circuit can take a project to a whole new level. Students learn to design circuits to optimize the form factor of their projects using EagleCAD, the software used for the mass production of printed circuit boards in engineering standards.   The course demonstrates best practices soldering techniques, acid etching, and 3D milling.   Students will learn to read and produce schematic diagrams, source components and time manage a prototyping process in order to produce a robust project ready to be reproduced.     This course is extremely hands-on and includes weekly assignments, lectures, demos and labs.		<br />

        	What does it mean to be a scientist? For much of the 20th century, the answer to this question was a man in a white lab coat with a Ph.D. and crazy hair. Amateur scientists existed, but with a few notable exceptions in fields like astronomy and archaeology, they had little chance to make a contribution to cutting-edge research. <br />
<br />
In the past decade, the Internet has begun to disrupt this model of professional science. Citizens can now make real contributions to cutting-edge science projects that involve studying everything from pulsars to proteins, using their PCs, laptops or mobile phones. This is a trend called citizen cyberscience. <br />
<br />
This course introduces a variety of ways to do citizen cyberscience, including volunteer computing, volunteer thinking and volunteer sensing.  It explores the contributions and the motivations of the volunteers who participate in such projects, as well as the sort of scientific and social impact that these projects are having. During the course, the goal for the students is to design and implement a citizen cyberscience project, in collaboration with scientists in several departments at NYU. 	<br />
<br />
NYU has just announced plans to create a Centre for Urban Science and Progress – the sort of science that impacts every citizen. To highlight this, the course will feature a number of guest speakers and offer a set of projects on the theme of 'urban science meets citizen science'. Topics will range from analyzing the city's traffic data to monitoring the demographics of local elections to studying the genetic makeup of bugs in your own home. 	  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Coming out of nowhere. Monotonous drone. Running out of steam. Pregnant pause. Unbearable build up in tension. Gratifying resolution. We use these phrases all the time to describe music and film, animation and dialogue. What are we actually talking about? Narrative and emotional arc and its more abstract cousin, composition.<br />
<br />
In this class, we will look at how to use simple computational strategies to compose patterns of events capable of producing emotional impact. To compose computationally is to abstract emotion into numbers and ratios so that we can figure out, for instance, that in order to achieve "shock", a pattern needs to be established for a certain number of seconds before it can be interrupted, and that interruption needs to be 3 times as "big" as what came before.<br />
<br />
The class is agnostic to medium. You can work with graphics, sound, kinetic sculpture or stories.<br />
<br />
The course is as much an exercise in cultivating personal sensitivity to the emotional power of patterns as it is a class in how to write code to generate such patterns. We will devote as much time to collecting and analyzing compelling examples of narrative and composition from visual art and music to storytelling as we do to writing coding. Projects will alternate between structured programming exercises and more creative assignments applying newly learned techniques to the medium of your choice.<br />

        	Comics are more than a narrative form they are a communication medium.  Using words and images to tell a story is a skill that is applicable to almost  everything we do. In this class you will learn the language of traditional  comics so you can hone your storytelling ability, and clarity of thought. We  will breakdown the sequential narrative process into the techniques  necessary to develop a compelling tale and look at how the audience and the  medium help to shape the final presentation of our ideas.  Students work on several projects to build up their skills that will culminate in the creation of a short feature comic written/drawn/programmed by each student that can be based on a previous assignment. This class does not teach specific programs or programming rather this class provides an opportunity for students to thoughtfully and creatively apply their skills toward specific assignments. You do not need to be a trained artist to take this class you do need to be willing to take chances with your work.  <br />

        	This class is about the intersection of computation, software, and fashion design.<br />
We will explore clothing design and production with digital tools like laser cutting, 3D printing, and scanning as well as traditional clothing construction techniques. The course will investigate unique approaches in materials, user interface, data, and process from Issey Miyake to Nike. Involving concepts from art, manufacturing, and product, the field of fashion and technology presents exciting possibilities for expanding on centuries of craft.<br />
Class structure will be small workshop assignments culminating to a final project.<br />
(Skills in Processing, web development, sewing, or 3D modeling are handy but not required.)		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Computers should see.  We depend most heavily on light to sense the world.  As our experience is increasingly mediated through networked computers, it is not surprising that cameras have become an integral part of them.  These camera/computer combinations have become small, cheap and ubiquitous in laptops, cellphones and microcontrollers and have gained coverage of every corner of life.   This class looks at the possibilities and the computer software for getting a hold of the signals coming in from these cameras.   Unfortunately what is trivial for our vision system is really hard in software.  This class attempts to side step these very difficult problem of computer vision by working in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, and ant farms. First the class will cover programming required to process or analyze each pixel of the incoming image for such things as background removal, finding edges, or tracking objects.  As a sensor, the video camera is appealing; delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe 3 bytes from a keyboard but this volumen of data also presents a nice coding challenge for students.  After covering the basics of pixel manipulation, the class will turn to higher level libraries for things like face tracking, multitouch, Wii, Kinect and augmented reality. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment which is a good next step from the Processing environment.  We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cellphone and even on a microcontroller.   The class requires ICM or similar programming background.			  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	“Computer Vision” refers to a broad collection of techniques that allow computers to make intelligent assertions about what's going on in digital images and video. Sometimes this means understanding the difference between an image of someone smiling and frowning, or something as low level as whether there is motion in front of a camera. Participants will be introduced to a brief history of computer vision and its relationship to media arts, but most of the time will be spent learning how to work with computer vision addons for openFrameworks: ofxCv for direct access to OpenCV, ofxKinect and ofxOpenNI for skeleton and depth sensing, and ofxFaceTracker for understanding faces.<br />
<br />
Prerequisite: ICM or equivalent.  Those students new to openFrameworks should attend an "Intro to OF" session with ITP residents in the beginning of the semester.<br />

        	The World Wide Web no longer stops at the edge of your screen. When it comes to products, if it powers up, it talks to another device. There's an increasing number of appliances coming on the market that feature web interfaces, but do they work well?  This class take a hands-on critical look at the emerging market for connected devices, and will present an overview of methods for connecting the physical world to web-based applications. We don't interact with connected appliances in the same way as we do when they're not connected. It's not enough just to bolt a touchscreen on an appliance and call it networked. In this course we'll consider what the emerging interaction patterns are, if any, and we'll develop some of our own as needed.<br />
<br />
This class can be seen as a narrower and more interaction design-based complement to Understanding Networks. The latter class provides a broader overview of the dynamics of data networks, while this class focuses specifically on the challenges of connecting embedded devices to web-based services. Neither class is a prerequisite for the other, however.<br />
<br />
The class will begin with a review of some existing connected devices on the market, in which we'll critique them as products of interaction design. Then we'll have several short exercises to introduce different tools, and a final hardware and software production project in which students develop a more fully realized networked device.<br />

        	The term "documentary" was coined by John Grierson, father of the documentary film, as the "creative treatment of actuality."  The web opens up massive potential for completely new kinds of documentaries: films that constantly update themselves with breaking information, are shaped by users, or are made more persuasive through personalization. <br />
<br />
In this course, you'll conceive, shoot, and code a short-form, connected documentary of your own. We'll be using the popcorn.js web video library to link and incorporate data from open APis, Facebook, and the wider web. You don't need to be a filmmaker or a developer, strictly speaking—just creative, bold, and interested in formal innovation.  		<br />

        	Generative Art creates a process of evolution, where most art imitates life, generative  art has a life of it’s own.  Artists, designers, architects have use generative methods for creating many times  without knowing.  How is it that we can create something that resonates with the user  on a level that cannot be quantiﬁed.  It is by providing the work with the means to have a life of it own.  These are the generative methods.  Techniques that are subtle, yet have the greatest effect: simple rules that dictate the shape or function of a work adding to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent.  In this class we will cover the generative methods and use them as tools for creating.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	People work and play in groups, so anything that changes the way groups form or interact will change the way people work and play. In the last decade, the social aspects of networked devices have moved from being regarded as an interesting side-effect to being one of the core design issues of the present era. The importance of shared online effort, from github and StackOverflow to Google Hangout and 4chan, is allowing us to re-think how and when people converse, cooperate, and collaborate. <br />
<br />
In this seminar, we will study what makes the design of software for group use special, and hard. The work of the class is a series of readings about social design problems generally (Prisoner's Dilemma, Tragedy of the Commons), alongside class discussion of interesting social spaces (github, Omegle, Branch, Discourse, Weird Twitter). You will examine existing social spaces and present your findings to the class, imagining how you might improve or degrade the social aspects of those sites. The final project will be a design proposal for a novel social space or service, or for a significant alteration of an existing one.		  		  		</div></li>

        	What is it about the propagation of compressed air waves that gives rise to such a vast panoply of history, culture, ideas and artworks?  What exactly does sound consist of, and how can we use (and abuse) it?   Utilizing sound in our projects is a lot like cooking: we find and make ingredients, manipulate them, mix them together, bake at 400º, serve.  Cooking With Sound explores the phenomenon of sound from the ground up, investigates its history, practice and potential as a medium for art, communication, and pleasure, and provides students the skills and knowledge for forming and shaping these potentials.  Topics include acoustics and the physics of sound (and how a single vibrating string gives rise to music theories around the world), the digitization of sound (and how you can do it yourself with a handful of resistors), sound as art medium and its interpretation and criticism, and the many various tools and techniques for wielding this ephemeral yet eternal wonder.		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

In addition to canvas graphics, the course will also cover HTML5 and DOM manipulation, working with APIs, data and JSON, interactivity across a range of devices, and the integration and use of other JS libraries. Strategies for code organization and structure, sharing and documentation, and version control (github) will also be discussed. <br />

Students will also learn basic principles of molecular gastronomy and modernist cuisine as framing devices for understanding how food also functions in the context of bodily health, environmental health as well as cultural and political narratives. Our food system consists of more than food production and consumption and this class will address how science and food science plays a more integral role in this system and how this knowledge can be mined for work that creatively and functionally contributes to this emerging field. Assignments for the class will be based on the incorporation of food science into design and technology projects that uses food as a substrate to explore and illuminate information within the food system.

        	Far from virtual, inert quantities, data exert real forces in the physical world -- They are incendiaries wielding the power of once-secret diplomatic cables, mores initiated with the flip of a privacy setting, and physical laws shaping urban structures with the quiet, persistent action of zoning regulations. Data are bribes, calls to action, and objects of coordination. Data build. Data destroy. Data renew. Data rarely act in isolation, gaining power through combination, "join"ing forces and moving into new terrain. Their presence is thought to guarantee transparency, their absence is seen as suspicious, and restrictions on their movement appear to be temporary, at best.  This course will deal in data, its collection, processing and interpretation.  It is not meant to be a study in data visualization, per se, although we will spend a lot of time looking at data. We will examine a mix of techniques from the "data arts and sciences," crossing, for example, statistics, computer science and media art. Work for this course might not have a visual component at all, but could instead represent a new way to organize, search or publish data. It might be a novel data collection strategy, a joining mechanism that crosses databases, or even a new statistical model and formal learning procedure. In short, we will examine the idea of data as "material" supporiting creative practices. Prerequisites: Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience. Prior knowledge of statistics or experience with data analysis is not required. Lessons will emphasize R and Python.

Our lives are being constantly measured, and information about us is being surveilled, stolen, and commodified. Dialogue around this data revolution has been dominated by corporations, governments, and industry - but what about the arts? In this class, we’ll investigate the means by which artists can engage (and are engaging) in the collection, processing, and representation of data. Using a research-focused, prototype-based approach, we’ll build a series of collective and individual projects to interrogate the ‘new data reality’.

        	The world is awash with data. In the last few years, a collision of technologies has allowed us to record massive amounts of information. The question that we are faced with now is: How can we make sense of it? In this course, we explore traditional analysis and visualization techniques, alongside novel strategies and exploratory methods. We build tools to navigate through huge data sets, and will learn how to represent data in visual, audial, and physical form. Students work in Processing to design and build their own unique data representation projects.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	We have access to more data and better and more powerful tools than ever before, and yet high-quality analysis is still largely the domain of professional data scientists. This course will cover those techniques for exploring data, cleaning it, and uncovering and communicating meaningful stories, while understanding concepts like error metrics, bias, and data product development. We'll primarily focus on technical and algorithmic techniques for practically navigating through data to draw interesting conclusions. While data visualization is a tool used in the service of data science, this is not a data visualization design class. Students will work through analyzing a few data sets as a group before selecting a final project where they complete an analysis and<br />
present the resulting story to the class.  Students will become familiar with the Python programming language (specifically iPython notebook). <br />

        	We are living in the dawn of the big data era, a time in which the vast digitization of our world has created incalculable amounts of information that is now being used to drive our every decision, from what movie we decide to watch this weekend to how we navigate the globe next year.  Though data can be immensely transformative, much of the efforts in data science are still focused on first-world gains, such as optimizing ad networks or recommending restaurants.  As designers, developers, and scientists, it is not only incumbent upon us to understand how to analyze, understand, and tell stories with data, but also to think about its use in meaningful and socially conscious ways.  This class will train students in the basic tools and trade of data science through exploration of a socially conscious data project.  Students will learn to scrape, merge, and clean data with Python, perform statistical analysis and use machine learning algorithms in R, and visualize and explore data with R and D3.  In addition to training students as junior data scientists, we will discuss the important social issues around data provenance, privacy, and the responsibility that comes with making claims from data.<br />

        	Design Expo is a collaborative design class.  Students work in groups to understand and then respond to a design challenge, posed by Microsoft Research (MSR), and then present their work for feedback and iteration. Past design challenges have included imagining tools or services for new infrastructure, such as ubiquitous connectivity or highly available data. Other challenges have involved particular design domains, such as health care. This year's theme will be announced in late November.<br />
<br />
Students work in a small group (3-5 people) to research the proposed challenge, propose possible innovations or solutions, then iterate those proposals. A successful proposal can be a demo ("We've imagined a new possibility, and this is what it would look like") or a prototype ("We've imagined a new possibility, and we built a small version of it.") At the end of the course, one group will be selected by outside reviewers to travel to Redmond, WA in July to present their proposal at MSR's Faculty Research Summit.		</div></li>

        	How do you take a project made at ITP and turn it into a product? From electronics projects on Kickstarter to bespoke leather goods and bike hardware, all successful products have one thing in common, they can be made reliably over and over again at high quality. In this class, 'Design for Editions' we will explore issues surrounding creating art and design objects so that they can be made more than once, by someone other than their creator; be that a limited edition of 10 or a full production run of 10,000. <br />
<br />
In two week segments we will look at: what is repeatability, designing for repeatability, creating process, specification/quotes, and quality control. In each segment students will produce a mini project focused on the current topic, look at examples of real world creators, and present their work to outside critics. The class will host guest lecturers and go on studio/factory visits in the NYC/Brooklyn area.<br />
<br />
The last six weeks of the class will be devoted to a final project whose outcome will be a fully specified product ready for production. Possible final projects could run the gamut from high-end design objects to art installations or custom electronics modules. Students are encouraged to bring in-process or past projects to develop further over the corse of the class.		  		  		</div></li>

<br />
This class give students an opportunity to work as a design and development team on a real project to develop an online community to bring information and resources to women in Haiti. Design principles and methodology will be learned within the context of this work. The  project, already underway, is an online portal  that seeks to address the needs of Haitian women and create a platform for empowerment and knowledge sharing.<br />
<br />
Students will develop innovative prototypes around:<br />
Content: educational and entertainment, listing of resources, emergency alerts, marketplace<br />
Delivery: best practices for open source platforms, text messaging, online radio, mobile theater, scalable model that can be applied to other countries<br />
Engagement: strategies for attracting users, creating partnerships, spreading the word<br />
<br />
The project is in an early stage and students will have the opportunity to significantly contribute and shape its direction and overall structure.<br />
<br />
By the end of the term students will present solutions to the 'client', that is the primary stakeholders of We Advance University:  led by the NGO We Advance (http://weadvance.org/) and Femme en Democratie (http://fed.org.ht/) with support from the State Department.<br />

        	UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund; http://unicef.org) takes on issues affecting the health, well-being, and opportunities of children and youth around the world. UNICEF's reach is wide -- it is the #1 purchaser of pencils, procures a billion dollars of vaccine a year and, in 2010, responded to emergencies in half of all nations. An increasingly important part of its mission is finding creative ways to address issues that negatively affect young lives. Design for UNICEF will focus on a relevant topic, such as disaster relief, nutrition, or the lives of adolescent girls. You will work in groups to research and design new tools and innovative extensions to existing efforts related to the topic. Your projects can use high or low/no technology and take the form of mock-ups/design proposals, or working prototypes. At the end of the semester, you'll present your work at UNICEF HQ to staff and invited guests. This class is all about rapid iteration and refinement, proposing and rejecting ideas, lots of collaboration, and coming to terms with the difficult and frustrating challenges of designing for people who are far away, facing problems that are very big.		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	The Design of Conversational Spaces starts with the observation that conversation is everywhere online, but that its quality ranges from excellent to execrable.  The negative end of that scale is astonishingly bad – moronic rants, off-topic rambles, vitriolic attacks. (“dude just stfu nobody watches ur videos just gtfo out of you tube oh no were hurting his little feelings i feel soo bad”.) It's enough to make you wish for the enforced public silence of 20th century media.  Yet not all online speech suffers this fate; many sites manage to host not just civil but productive conversations, from the talk pages on Wikipedia to the design conversations on github to political debate on Comment is Free. Programmers have contentious but respectful conversations on StackOverflow and #winprog; crafters on Etsy and Ravelry; mathematicians on Polymath; pop artists on DeviantArt.  This class is about the design of environments that support or encourage good conversation. We explore what makes comments on YouTube so bad, and on Ravelry so good, a bundle of differences that includes the scale of the audience, the commitment of the participants to each other and to shared enterprise, and the willingness and ability of the participants police violations.  The class is designed to explore three forces that affect online conversation: Forces that set conversational context (scale, homophily, identity) Forces that guide conversations (visual and verbal cues, social rules) Forces that restrict conversations (membership, karma, moderation)  These will be your toolkit for thinking about conversational design. The goal of the course is to sketch out a "pattern language" for the kinds of choices designers make when creating conversational or interactive interfaces or tools, and to understand the inevitable tradeoffs involved.		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	The ability to digitally fabricate parts and whole pieces directly from our computers or design files used to be an exotic and expensive option not really suitable for student or designer projects, but changes in this field in the past 5 years have brought these capabilities much closer to our means, especially as ITP students. ITP and NYU now offer us access to laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D stereolithography. In this class we will learn how to design for and operate these machines. Emphasis will be put on designing functional parts that can fit into a larger project or support other components as well as being successful on a conceptual and aesthetic level.  In this class we will discover methods to design projects on CAD applications for total control of the result, and we will develop algorithmic ways to create designs from software (Processing) to take advantage of the ability to make parts and projects that are unique, customizable, dependent on external data or random. The class will include 3 assignments to create projects using the three machines (laser, router, 3D) and the opportunity to work on a final project.		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	For centuries, great works of music, theater, and dance, have combined art and science to make integrated performances that move audiences.  Today, we are seeing major changes as artists experiment with video and real-time interactivity to draw audiences even deeper into the performance, and enhance the shared experience of the moment.  This class explores conceptual approaches to design, contemporary software, prototyping frameworks, and data flow programming to provide student designers with the cutting-edge tools necessary to confidently collaborate with writers, directors, and performers.  Structured as a studio course, students will make designs for iconic theater pieces, and collaborate with working artists to design original projects.		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Most social media platforms follow a similar recipe. A user signs up, creates a profile, contributes / shares content, posts comments, builds a reputation, etc. What makes each social media platform unique is the object of conversation, the intended purpose and the participatory culture that arises from its use. In this course, we will learn how to design and develop a fully functional social media platform using HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP and MySQL. An emphasis will be placed on creating applications that operate both on desktop computers and mobile devices. In addition, topics related to information architecture, interface design, cloud computing and leveraging existing web services will be discussed.

        	Digital cameras and printers are making photography more ubiquitous and more useful than ever.  This course is a workshop that looks at changing the rules for capturing and printing digital imagery.  By gaining a better understanding of the engineering fundamentals and limitations of digital photography, students can produce breathtaking images with all the benefits of digital media but with an image quality that rivals film. Students experiment using low cost, hands-on tips and tricks in software and hardware to capture high dynamic range, expanded color, night color, 3D, time lapse, and stop motion images using a digital camera and printer.  While using mostly off-the-shelf tools, these experiments require students to dig down to see the nitty-gritty of today's and tomorrow's technologies for digitally sensing, encoding, compressing, transmitting and displaying images.		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	In this course we’ll explore Realtime 3D as a medium for artistic expression and develop our own interactive experiences that take place in virtual spaces. We’ll critically survey a broad selection of Realtime 3D works, from traditional video games to more experimental interactive experiences. To create our own worlds, we’ll be using Unity3D, a free full-featured 3D game engine.<br />
For the first half of class, a series of weekly exercises will introduce different topics in Unity including 3D models, textures, shaders, lighting and animation. We’ll be writing code in C#, Unity’s preferred language, but students may choose to use JavaScript as well. For the second half, students will work on a larger final project that conveys some kind of narrative through interactions in a virtual space. Group collaborations are encouraged.<br />
Students are encouraged to adapt source material from a broad range of sources. We’ll look at off-the-shelf motion capture animation from sites light Mixamo, creating models using 3D scanning with a Kinect and middleware solutions from the Unity Asset Store.		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	In the past few years, hands-on learning and do-it-yourself making have taken off in electronics and fabrication of soft and hard goods. This represents a new case of a perennial enterprise dynamic: Disruption. That's what happens when an established industry is confronted by a new technological way of doing things, and all habits, business models, and attitudes must change. <br />
<br />
In this case, the established industry that is being disrupted is.... industry itself. The driving forces behind this sweeping change include increasing sophistication, ease-of-use, and accessibility of digital fabrication software and hardware tools; the lowering of costs of components and raw materials; the rise of wages around the world, making outsourcing a less viable alternative; affordable overnight and short-term shipping; information sharing on the internet; and an ecological imperative that encourages a more effective use of materials and energy. <br />
<br />
Advocates of the maker movement are bullish on its potential for changing the way all industry operates -- including the way we design, make, sell, and distribute things, and even the way we learn about industrial production. On one level, this disruption seems inevitable and predetermined. However, the speed, breadth, and impact of this change are all uncertain. We have seen many highly viable technologies have little or no impact; and some have changed every aspect of the world. Will digital fabrication be the next search engine, or the next Segway? <br />
<br />
The aim of this class is to examine the potential size and impact of the maker movement and to consider the unexamined consequences of it. In assignments and discussion, students will articulate what the movement means to individuals, where it may lead industry and institutions, and how it could affect the fabric of industry. In the process, we will study existing knowledge about the dynamics of disruption, the cultural changes involved with changing technology, and the relationship between dynamic manufacturing and conventional manufacturing processes. Then we'll check our assumptions with research about the current reality of the movement.<br />
<br />
This will be a discussion and research class. In-class discussions will be fed by assigned readings, students' research and interviews, and possibly invited guests. Final projects can include in-depth reports explaining the subjects at hand; well-researched scenarios about the possible directions this might take; or designs for methods, or practices or tools related to the subject at hand.		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Traditional medical care focuses on fixing sickness but doesn't do a very good job of helping prevent it. Self-care solutions that help us take better care of ourselves have the potential to improve our health and well-being, and may keep us from experiencing the consequences of chronic disease, or even reversing it. The sensor and self-tracking revolution is changing our understanding of data and ourselves. We need new systems that collect, understand and interpret this data to help us know ourselves better and make better choices in light of that knowledge. How might we design a self-care system that engages us in our own monitoring, goal setting, experimenting, reflecting and understanding as it relates to our bodies, minds, emotions, relationships and environment?  Since self-care applies to all of us, you will focus inwardly on your own needs and situations. The goal of the course is to design a self-care system that helps us take stock of ourselves by exploring ways to measure, reflect and act upon our health and lifestyle. We make interactive interfaces, visualizations and feedback systems that use existing technologies and methods to support our health and well-being.  Students employ design techniques to develop problem statements, generate concepts, prototype, and then test and refine your solutions to evolve them into high-fidelity prototypes that use sketches, scenarios, videos and user journeys to convey the complete user experience. The emphasis is on the lightest weight prototype, which works through the solution over actual implementations in software and hardware.  Significant portions of class time are set aside for teamwork, designing and critique.		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Beginning with Gregor Mendel's masterful study of inheritable traits in pea plants and the groundbreaking discovery of the three-dimensional structure of DNA, this class sets out to uncover the biological mechanisms at play and the specialized equipment and protocols being used in today's laboratories, studios, and garages. The emerging biohacking and DIY Bio movements of today are heavily built on scientific breakthroughs that have occurred only recently. Over the course of the semester, we will study the principles underlying many of these key breakthroughs like the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), the generation of the first recombinant DNA molecules (genetic engineering), and the rise of shotgun genome sequencing (DNA sequencing) all in an effort to better understand modern biology -- from DNA to genes to genomes. Class work will include individual exercises, in-class labs (Bacterial transformations using E. Coli and Green Fluorescent Protein for example), assigned readings, and group presentations. Additionally, students will be asked to develop their own projects inspired by the concepts covered. The ultimate goal of this class is to equip students with enough knowledge and skill to explore biologically driven concepts and projects with confidence. Although topics from molecular biology will be covered, no previous knowledge is required. 			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	The objective of this course is to explore analog and digital drawing not only as a static exercise, but also as a tool for performance installation and collaboration. The course will explore different methods for expression and capturing output.  Examples include drawing under camcorders, digital projection, digital drawing software, and simple code platforms.  Students will gain the skill and confidence to draw in real time using a variety of different mediums, improve their improvising skills, and learn to perform without delay. 		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Drawing is often the beginning of relaying an idea. It constitutes the most intimate form of making and is the testing ground for new thoughts. “Drawing without ego” means letting go of fears of what you think drawing should be, and just letting it happen – feeling comfortable enough to use drawing as an alphabet to build thoughts visually, like language is built from letters. The course encourages the student to experiment and develop a visual idea, more than to create finished work. Assignments include sketching out proposals for new work – storyboarding, etc. – building a visual vocabulary through various forms of improvisation, as well as the more conventional practice of drawing from the model and still life. Students bring their knowledge of interactive telecommunications to drawing and find ways to let drawing enter into their design work. In this introductory drawing class students are urged to draw anything they want, exploring the freedom of expression that comes from playing with one's imagination and memory and creating convincing imagery with or without references. The class will have informal critiques, and will visit galleries to look at contemporary art. Weekly assignments are required.  <br />

        	If you ever had a need to collect information from users on the web or use external data in your project, understanding web development will make your life much easier. The class will explore interaction between server-side and client-side of web development using Python and JavaScript. On the client-side, we will cover traditional JavaScript and the jQuery library to manipulate browser content, create and trigger page events and make AJAX data requests. Developing with Python on the server-side, we will explore receiving input from a user then querying and saving that data to a database, and finally, returning the appropriate content to the client, i.e. HTML or JSON. The websites we use today are rarely on a single database, we will focus on consuming data APIs from websites like Foursquare (for location information), Facebook (for social graph). Going further, we will create custom data APIs for use at ITP and open to the public. Students must have prior HTML & CSS experience or be willing to learn it outside of class. Introduction to Computational Media or prior object oriented programming knowledge is required.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Overview: <br />
How does interactive design create powerful emotional experiences? What are keys to engaging the mind at the affective stage of awareness? As computing becomes more physical, creators have an opportunity to connect with audiences in new ways. Using the body as the canvas for play, we explore tactics for unlocking affective experiences. Delving into the basics of embodied design, students will develop, prototype and test experiences with the primary aim of creating a profound emotional state. Any software/hardware is acceptable for this class as the design principles covered are universal. However, we will be using Processing, Unity, and C# with a wide range of controllers for the example lessons in class. Upon completing the class, students will present a finished piece of work with the aim of creating a specific emotion. <br />
<br />
Topics include: <br />
Affective Computing, 3rd Wave HCI, Affective Design, Unity Basics, C#, Gesture Design, Machine Learning & Gesture Training, Kinect, Wii, OpenNI<br />
<br />
Technical Experience: <br />
Take this class with a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming to get the most out of it. However, if you do not have any programming skills, you are welcome to take the class and hand in design prototypes made with paper or other craft supplies until we finish the unity section of the course.		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	As humans we know each other through speech and gesture, time spent with each other, shared histories and geographies. But how can we really know another person.It's hard with someone we know well... much less someone who is not at all like us, who is a stranger, whose worldview may be totally different from our own, who may be our enemy. This is a studio class/workshop to engage these questions which have such urgency in the world today. It's about politics, society and art, how we-- as performers, storytellers, interaction designers-- can explore with our conversation, our intelligence, our whole bodies, and  creative spirit might work to discover how to embody and feel with the other. This class is a joint offering with Performance Studies and ITP. Eight students from each. <br />
<br />
The class is a studio/workshop class. It will meet for 7 sessions on Sundays, 12-6. Dates  and place to be determined.<br />

Building on skills developed in physical computing, we will, through generating and measuring electricity, gain a more nuanced and quantitative understanding of energy in various forms. We will turn kinetic and solar energy into electrical energy, store that in batteries and capacitors, and use it to power small projects. Several sessions will include hands-on labs. We will develop skills useful in a variety of undertakings, from citizen science to art installations, and address a range of topics through the lens of energy.

        	This six-week course will explore and prototype digital money systems,  game points, social currency, transactional models, and investing platforms. We will consider the  future of work, financial activism, even startup mechanics in our quest to determine if and how the West would move from a growth-based industrial age economy to a sustainable digital economic. What would that even look like?<br />
<br />
Does digital technology offer new approaches to economic activity, or will it merely reify those put in place centuries ago for the printing press era? What are the values inherent but generally unrecognized in the economic operating system we use, and who or what do these values foster? What mechanisms for transaction - either in-game or real-world - can we build, and how can we embed them with the biases we choose?<br />
<br />
The course will involve lecture, seminar, and readings, followed by prototyping and development of transactional mechanisms by individuals and groups. Readings will vary according to student interest and projects, but will focus on works by Rushkoff, David Graeber, Jaron Lanier, Bernard Lietaer, Adam Smith, Hayek, Charles Eisenstein, Eric Schmidt, and Art Brock.<br />
<br />
Students should come to the first class having read Rushkoff's "Monopoly Moneys," available in PDF here: <a href="http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2012-0712-200619/rushkoff.pdf">http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2012-0712-200619/rushkoff.pdf</a> - or at least Chapter Four to the end.	<br />

        	Of the top 20 grossing movies of 2013, more than half were based on a classic comic, TV show, or book -  fan-service designed to cater to a pre-existing audience. The rise of the tech sector has turned fandom into big business, and the media is scrambling to serve it.  As technology blurs traditional identities based on gender, race and geography, fan attachments have become central to who we are and what we create.<br />
<br />
Fandom is the study of community formed around popular culture, whether it’s a shared love of Harley Davidson, PBR, Lady Gaga, 3D printing or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  In marketing, proper fan management can mean life or death for a project, and many companies are discovering the hard way that mishandling fan input and goodwill can lead to disaster.  From Air Jordans to World of Warcraft, we explore the influences that transform users into fans, and the techniques we can use as designers to take advantage of it. We’ll investigate the sociology behind fandom’s evolution from the early stigmatization of 18th century religious and music manias to its recent redemption as the driving force behind the brands, celebrities, and media of modern-day nerd culture.<br />

        	Crash course in ethnographic field testing<br />
<br />
Field testing is the art of finding out how actual humans in a real context use, comprehend, and make meaning out of what you’re developing. The aim is to understand how your project does or doesn’t do and mean what you think it should, to find the things it does and means that you didn’t expect, and adapt it based on these insights. This course gives students an introduction to ethnographic methods, prototyping, and experience developing the observational skills required to do useful, rigorous, holistic field testing. Coursework includes reading, discussion, project testing and writeups of test results. Students are expected to test projects they’re making in other courses, rather than produce new work for the course.<br />

        	It used to be that only the rich could put eyes in the sky. But dramatic aerial images of riots, natural disasters and pollution events –captured by citizen journalists using low-cost hardware suggest a politically transformative leveling of the playing field.<br />
<br />
Even so, the cheapest quadcopter can still carry the threat of evisceration and fatality. And at least in the U.S., drone journalism is technically illegal— for now. <br />
<br />
Let’s explore the future prospects for drone journalism. In this class, you’ll learn about the law, technology, and practice of drone journalism. You’ll meet the pioneers of the field, gain a conceptual understanding of the space through programming toy drones, and finally conceive and participate in a drone journalism mission.		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Flying robots, aka Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, are growing in number and influence in military use. In parallel, the hobbyist community is developing DIY methods, making flying robots more accessible to more people. What is yet to become common is for these DIY aircraft to carry out visions rather than simply take pictures. This course aims to provide the conceptual and technical foundation for using flying robots for visionary purposes. Here, technology is the tool. The air vehicle is the paintbrush, the poster, the camera; visible to some degree but not the purpose. The first step is to strip down the employment of a flying robot to its essence, as a means to gather information or take action at a distance, using an autonomous agent. The group will discuss and expand the current thinking on feasible, worthy objectives for flying robots, from art to science, from observation to communication, from performance to activism. Throughout the course, these conceptual topics will be a backdrop for hands-on projects using accessible technology. <br />
<br />
The projects will investigate:<br />
<br />
• Performing a task with a flying robot<br />
• Moving information and decision-making<br />
• Making a craft fly autonomously<br />
<br />
The projects will be performed in small teams and will require conceptualization, system design, and mechanical, electrical and coding work. The types of small aircraft could include quadcopters, blimps, planes, or less conventional platforms. Flight controls will be done using the Arduino-based ArduPlane and ArduCopter, or other embedded computing platforms. The online DIY/hobbyist community will be used as a resource. Each week, class will include a brief lecture and discussion followed by demonstration and debugging of projects.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This seven-week course will test the premise that making an experience fun will influence positive behavior.  This class is inspired by (but not tethered to) thefuntheory.com, an initiative of Volkswagon. We will look at the research related to the psychology of behavior and try to answer the question - is incentive-based design effective? After researching theories on behavior motivation each student will identify a problem or issue that they hope to influence. Students will document the problem, develop a concept  to influence the behavior associated with that problem and prototype (or build) their solution. They will test their solution and draw conclusions from the experiment. Projects can attempt to influence social change at a large, social scale or at a personal level. The unifying theme behind the projects will be that they intend to inspire positive change. We will look at examples of persuasive technology and the research of BJ Fogg, Dan Lockton and others.	<br />

        	This course covers the next several years of evolution in technology, culture, and other trends. It uses scenario planning, a technique for considering complex interrelationships that can’t be predicted, distinguishing predetermined elements from critical uncertainties, and exploring the underlying patterns that influence events. Students will conduct original research on significant trends, use those trends to develop compelling, sophisticated, plausible stories about possible futures, and present the futures - and the strategies they suggest - to a public audience. The goal of the course is to enable you to make more robust decisions now in the face of uncertainty — applicable to planning for technological change, starting a business, plotting a career or making major life decisions. This class has developed a longstanding following at ITP because it enables people to make sense of complex issues without oversimplifying them. In a progression of discussion and debate, the class explores theories about system dynamics, organizational and societal change, and economic and technological development. 		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	DIY GERMLINE IGM ARTs encourages students to begin to practice re-design of human heredity through transgenic methods. Intentional Genetically Modified Human Genome Arts questions style and innovation in our genepool through a critical hands-on examination. The class begins by redefining where and how we interface with life, through some of the following hands-on wet laboratories --<br />
<br />
1: Bioinformatics :: Literary Studies<br />
<br />
2: Bacteriology :: Tranformed Painting<br />
<br />
3: Ethology :: Art for All Phylla<br />
<br />
4: Body Art :: Developmental Biology<br />
<br />
5: Food Science :: Gastronomic Arts<br />
<br />
6: Ecology :: Ecoart<br />
<br />
In combination, the bioart labs will approximate a Do-It-yourself (DIY) protocol towards artistic Intentional Genetic Modification of the Human Genome (IGM.)<br />
<br />
Readings and discussions are directed towards cultural issues such as gene patenting, population diversity, new reproductive technologies and nature/culture boundary issues as they pertain to IGM. The analysis is directed towards the state of present day and near future Post/Trans-Human Engineering. The exploration of the issues and techniques of the study of life will aid and inform our expressive productions. In particular, the ethics of living transgenic humans as art and/or science production will be approached.<br />
<br />
Creative bioresearch is a personal expression of explorative experience. This class is for the production of living arts addressing the future of genetically modified humans. The combination of in-depth study and living art commentary should make this an intriguing class for anyone who is generally curious about life in particular.  Artists from all mediums, those of the medical arts, sciences and social sciences are all encouraged attend.<br />
<br />
On successful completion of this course, you will have had:<br />
<br />
• Conducted independent and original research that uses the tool of life for self expression.<br />
<br />
• Critically evaluated your work and the works of others through non-normative bioethics.<br />
<br />
• Gained an ability to discuss biotechnological issues from first hand non-scientific experience.<br />

        	What kinds of video narratives does the Internet allow or encourage? How does the intimacy of millions of viewers sitting alone at home change the possibilities for public story-telling? What thrives? What fails? And why? And maybe most importantly: what kinds of stories get told, when the financial pressure of needing a vast audience is removed? We explore existing work (including talks with some of the leading makers in the field) and create our own - with a goal of challenging traditional media and crafting the kinds of stories we ourselves would like to see. Part production (a brief overview of camera/editing technique) part studio, this class explores the ways technology can enhance and inspire the creative act.

How do the tools and media we use affect the work we create? What biases are embedded in the software and data formats we take for granted? In this class we will reverse, invert, and deconstruct prescribed workflows. We'll empower ourselves by digging into the intricacies of different formats. We'll explore the limitations of our tools, and exploit the strange behavior at those limits. We'll also spend a significant amount of time understand the history and theory behind glitch and noise, through enlightening readings, discussion, and exercises.<br />

<br />
To be pragmatic, people build new tools on top of whatever happens to be available at the moment. Processing was built on Java, openFrameworks and Arduino were build on C++ and it all works well enough.<br />
<br />
But to be truly expressive with code, we have to discard pragmatism and think very seriously about the tools we use, and the tools our tools are built on. The perspective of this course is that in order for technology to make serious, non-incremental progress, we need more artists thinking about the governing dynamics of it all. We cannot get to where we want by taking what we have for granted and layering on top of it.<br />
<br />
This course will guide students through the art and science of designing a programming language. This will include writing parsers, compilers and interpreters as well as discussing and exploring different ways of structuring thought on a machine. Students will also explore the history of code, with particular focus on languages no longer in common use that presented radically different ways of thinking about code. These languages will be discussed, used, and dissected as a source of inspiration and study for the new languages that will be developed in the class.		  		  		  		</div></li>

<br />
We live in an era of unprecedented technological innovation with ingenious new advances for achieving clean energy, eradicating disease and providing greater wellness, more equitably and effectively delivering education, and improving the quality of human existence and expression. At the same time, we are experiencing clear deficits within centralized institutions of government and civil society: deficits of agility, innovation and capacity.<br />
<br />
These traditional institutions are failing to tap into the diversity of expertise and experience of individuals and communities, rendering us less able to quickly discover, recognize, implement and scale innovative approaches to pressing problems and making it impossible to translate technological innovation into social progress.<br />
<br />
Our current system of centralized government institutions is designed for an earlier age of limited, one-way communication. Consider:<br />
<br />
Our 18th century model of voting for representatives doesn’t maximize the flow of personal or community preferences from people to government.<br />
<br />
Our19th century addition of professional bureaucracy doesn't maximize the flow of expertise, widely distributed in society.<br />
Put another way, we can’t make the best decisions in government on how to improve people’s lives if we limit public participation and feedback to voting every few years. And we can’t adequately take advantage of people’s talents, abilities and desire to play a role in governing if we relegate their service to civic engagement disconnected from the real power, money and decision-making.<br />
<br />
Governments appropriate plenty for innovation in society. They fund research grants; invest in broadband infrastructure; support science education. But they spend next to nothing on reinventing government institutions by informing and empowering citizen to participate. There is no other industry, and not one as big as the public sector, that doesn’t regularly improve on its core business model.<br />
<br />
New technology has the potential to transform governance and produce a more open and participatory political culture with effective institutions that engender trust.<br />
<br />
New technology makes collaborative problem solving possible. In this course, we explore how we might use technology -- from big data to social media -- to redesign our systems of governance to devolve power from centralized, hierarchical institutions and evolve more robust collaboration among individuals, groups and institutions including government and the media.<br />
<br />
Through blogging assignments, discussions and a final design project, participants will apply what we learn about innovation to the issues about which they are the most passionate.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	New communications tools offer the opportunity to improve the accessibility, measurability, convenience, and cost of higher education. Doing so, however, means deciding which goals to design for -- Skills transfer? Experiential learning? Personal re-invention? Networking? Certification? -- and how those competing goals should be bundled or unbundled. <br />
<br />
This class will ask students to look at ways to reinvent higher education to increase its accessibility and exceed the current quality of the experience. Students will survey current experiments such as University of the People, Khan Academy, Codecademy, Meetups, TED Talks, General Assembly, and hackerspaces. Guest speakers working in this space will join the class discussions. <br />
<br />
Students will work individually and in groups to imagine re-designed lectures, discussions, student collaboration, assessment, and certification.  The final project will be an education module, of the student's own design and construction, launched to the public for feedback.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your computational project ideas will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas.  This fourteen week course is divided in two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body & how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard & monitor interface & at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere & sense & actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog & serial input & output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision & 3D graphics. The Java-based ‘Processing’ programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor & actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	Ideas Taking Shape will explore the language of physical things - how form, materiality, symbolism, and context, express an object’s message.<br />
Henry Ford said, “every object tells a story, if you know how to read it”.<br />
This course will expand students’ design vocabulary and sensitivity. By raising awareness of design choices made in existing objects, we start to understand their language. Enabling students to express physical computing ideas with more intention and personality. Going beyond simply putting electronic components into a box.<br />
<br />
Each class focuses on a different aspect of product design, through lectures, hands-on workshops, and weekly assignments.<br />
Design is an iterative process, we will explore all stages involved in the evolution of expressing a concept as an object. Look at historical and contemporary design practices for style and fabrication context. Study human behaviour and ergonomics, to make informed interaction decisions - for example, how should something you talk into look different from something you touch. We will learn to sketch and prototype for design ideation. Ultimately unifying all learned design semantics into a final project, that engages and clearly communicates its story to an audience.<br />

        	Interpretive Exhibition Design is the creative process by which spaces become designed environments in which the visitor is engaged in an orchestrated experience—one which inherently and explicitly imparts meaning and perspective, engages the emotions, may offer contemplation, encourage curiosity and afford discovery and learning. The creation of exhibition experiences in the museum, and alternative spaces, is a growing and fascinating field; one which increasingly draws upon new interactive technologies, and seeks to encourage social dynamics.  Understanding the interpretive role of design as a mediator between content and the audience, is helpful in both planning and deciphering underlying messaging and values embedded in any exhibition experience. The interpretive exhibition design process is important in developing a deeper appreciation for and understanding of expression in art, science and the natural world, time and history, society and of ourselves.  This course is a hands-on introduction to this kind of exhibit design: the interpretive process of creating experience in the museum space.  Professionals from a range of institutions will come to the class to speak or take us on field trips in their institutions to expose the class to a range of experiences within their exhibition environments; relating how and why they are conceived and created. We will take a critical look at how effectively they realized their design intent and imagine other alternative possibilities.  The class will form an understanding of the range of the museum-based exhibition experiences, and a deeper understanding of the underlying interpretive exhibition design process. We will bracket this range of experience design with a visit to a commercial exhibition venue and a commercial art gallery. Students will keep a diary of their experiences and observations, and notes on the design process based on each visit, and this will be used as a basis for a midterm presentation. For the final project—deconstructing an exhibition experience— an exhibition will be chosen as a case study, giving consideration to all the design elements and their role in creating a potentially powerful and unique experience in the museum space.  Students will present to a group of guest museum professionals at the American Museum of Natural History . 		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This class mines the many relationships between human and non-human animals, in order to depict, redefine or examine these relations through art and design. Using Donna Haraway's “When Species Meet” as a source text, this class explores human/animal connections through art and design works. Students will make two projects that take on animal consciousness, interspecies interactions, and critical areas of concern around species' coexistence. No technical skills are covered in this class, however students are asked to engage with technology in the creation of projects.This work will be accompanied by a survey of media, science and design works made in the context of "animal critical studies."<br />

        	Graphical dataflow programming languages like the Max family (Pd, Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) provide an intuitive approach to media programming and manipulation. This paradigm is based on mapping out the flow of the data, which more closely mirrors the experience of realtime media. This course introduces dataflow programming in Pure Data aka Pd: it starts with the basics of the language itself, core control structures and math, storing data and getting it in and out, working with various media formats, and ends with how to organize large projects.  The Max paradigm is compared to text-based languages like Processing to develop an idea of their differences and similarities, as well as respective strengths and weaknesses. This course is structured around learning by doing, so students have regular assignments to explore the ideas covered in class, as well as a small final project. This course uses Pd, but it covers core concepts of the Max family, so the knowledge is directly applicable to Max/MSP. This two point course which runs the first seven weeks is designed to be paired with either "Programmatic Audio" or "Boxes And Lines For Rods And Cones", both offered in the second seven weeks of the semester.

        	145 years since the publication of one of the ultimate treatises about mechanical movements - <i>Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements</i> by Henry T. Brown, we are going to revisit some of those 507 mechanical movements again, build physical motion models, and explore potential kinetic design implementations. This one point course will meet two times. The first class will be an all day workshop. We will begin by looking at selected movements from the rich pool of 507 movements and exploring their operation. We will then look at models of some of the movements and explore both simple prototyping techniques (using assorted model making materials & Lego kits) and more advanced prototyping techniques (laser-cutting or 3D printing of mechanical components). Next we will have a hands-on workshop in which each student selects a mechanism to prototype. <br />
<br />
In the second class students will present their final mechanism prototypes actuated by a motor. We will conclude with a creative brainstorm generating ideas for potential future design implementations of the prototyped mechanisms. 	 <br />

        	It has been exactly 100 years since Marcel Duchamp created what is considered the first kinetic sculpture (Bicycle Wheel). Over these 100 years artists from all over the world have used almost every conceivable material and technology to create kinetic sculptures that are powered by wind, sun, water, electricity and human power. In the past 25 years digital technology has been added to the chest of tools at the disposal of artists, and kinetic sculptures can now be smart and respond to their surroundings and interact with their viewers or even with people on the internet. Indeed kinetic sculptures can even visualize ever changing datasets on the net. Our way of thinking at ITP as well as the tools we use (physical computing, programming, rapid prototyping, design development, networks) position us at a very interesting intersection, very suitable for creating new forms of kinetic sculpture. <br />
<br />
In this workshop students will have an opportunity to work on a few short term projects as well as develop and fabricate a final kinetic sculpture. <br />
<br />
The workshop will include readings and research as well as guest presentations.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

Students will learn about LED, LCD and other more architectural displays as well as look at a variety of software and content creation tools that are used to drive such displays. The class will be focussed on creating a project to be presented at the LED Lab in Tribeca (website is in the process of being updated). There will be an initial quick structured project that students will use to test there content and better understand issues such as resolution, scale, speed of motion and color. Students will then develop an idea for their final project that they will develop and test out at the LED Lab 2-3 times before the final presentation/event. <br />
<br />
The LED Lab contains a variety of different LED Products, LCD arrays, media servers, lighting implements and features the UVA designed D3 software that can build and control media displays as well as lighting in 3d. <br />

        	This course teaches the ins and outs of using imagery in real-time, whether in a performance or installation context.  The class will use a variety of software manipulate visual media (time-based, still, vector, and rendered) in real-time to allow students to develop interesting real-time systems. While the focus of this class is on using imagery for visual work (mainly a software package called Jitter), it also looks at how to integrate interactive elements (sound, physical interfaces, etc.) into an integrated practice.  Class time is spent on interface design and software development issues as well. The class explores some interesting capabilities of the software in terms of real-time computer vision, projection mapping, generative graphics systems, and media transcoding. Throughout the class students develop and share ideas on live performance and interactive installation as a medium for visual expression, and learn the software tools necessary to put these ideas into practice in the form of idiosyncratic performance systems.  A final presentation in the form of a group performance will be arranged.  Students should have some working knowledge of Max/MSP before taking this class, although class projects can be executed on a variety of platforms.<br />

        	The World Wide Web has grown up to be a great platform for asynchronous communication such as email and message boards which has extended into media posting and sharing. Recently, with the rise of broadband, more powerful computers and the prevalence of networked media devices, synchronous communications have become more viable. Streaming media, audio and video conference rooms and text based chat give us the ability to create new forms of interactive content for live participants.<br />
<br />
In this course, we’ll focus on the types of content and interaction that can be supported through web based and live interactive technologies as well as explore new concepts around participation. Specifically, we’ll look at new and emerging platforms on the web such as HTML5, WebSockets and WebRTC using JavaScript and Node.js.<br />

        	Artists build on top of science. Today's cutting edge math and computer science research becomes tomorrow's breakthrough creative projects.<br />
<br />
Computer vision algorithms, machine learning techniques, and 3D topology are becoming vital prerequisites to doing daily work in creative fields from interactive art to generative graphics, data visualization, and digital fabrication. If they don't grapple with these subjects themselves, artists are forced to wait for others to digest this new knowledge before they can work with it. Their creative options shrink to those parts of this research selected by Adobe for inclusion in prepackaged tools.<br />
<br />
This class is designed to help you start seizing the results of this research for your own creative work. You'll learn how to explore the published academic literature for techniques that will help you build your dream projects. And you'll learn how to use those techniques to make those projects a reality.<br />
<br />
Each week we'll explore a technique from one of these research fields. We'll learn to understand the original research and see how to implement it in code that you can use in your projects. You'll learn to use the marching squares algorithm to detect fingers or make 3D models into something you can laser cut. You'll learn how to use support vector machines to train your own object detector or analyze a body of text. We'll cover a series of such topics, each of which has a wide range of applications in different creative media.<br />

        	Much data and many services are now accessible through public APIs - Application Programming Interfaces - from sites such as YouTube, Google Maps, Twitter, and Xively. But how can we access these datasets and services? How can we transfer, store, initialize, and display this data on our own pages? And how might we use the data to create unique and creative web experiences of our own? <br />
<br />
This class is about building interactive single-page web applications that leverage public data from a range of existing web services. The overall goal of the class will be for each student to have 3 functional well-designed single-page web applications by end of semester. Much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, mostly Javascript, for front-end (in-browser) web development. We will use a number of frameworks, including JQuery, Underscore, PaperJs, and D3. Where backend work is required, we will use Node-Express.  Students should have some programming experience (ICM) as well as a basic understanding of web development (Comm Lab Web). Experience with Javascript is a plus.		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	You’ve built a foam prototype. Your project idea is now out in the open sitting on a table where you and your teammates can look at it. It’s not quite what you thought it would be when you made your first rough sketch, there’s even something a little goofy about it, but then there’s also that interesting curve that you hadn’t envisioned. Your teammates have also noticed some things that you hadn’t thought of. You see where you can reshape the foam to make the prototype both look and work better. You’ve made your first step; you’ve moved your project forward.  Removing barriers to creative problem solving and learning the steps for advancing a project are the dual purposes of this course. You’re asked to make things over and over during your time at ITP. This class helps you to break out of 2-d screen and keyboard thinking and take advantage of the discoveries that inevitably occur when you're thinking in 3-d by manipulating materials with your hands, observing the results, and refining successive iterations of your idea. From techniques for prototyping and making small objects to fabrication methods for kiosks, you’ll get hands-on experience with a variety of materials and methods. You have an idea for a wearable device? Mock it up with the sewing machine. You're thinking about a squeezable children’s toy with sensors? Make a mold and cast some sensors inside soft rubber. You want to build an installation? Make a foam core model of the space and get a valuable preview of your project installed.  During the course you'll be introduced to building in a variety of materials. You’ll make objects of wood, foam, plastic, metal, clay, plaster, rubber, paper and fabric. You’ll move a project from sketch to prototype to presentation and learn to incorporate the lessons of the process into your final product. By taking notice of the unexpected your original concept will evolve, and amplified by those revelations it will surprise you and delight your audience.		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This seminar and laboratory considers the impact of interactivity and technology on traditional narrative structure, and explores new methods for conveying the essential narrative elements in non-linear and interactive forms of art, entertainment, and communications. Throughout, we will be formulating approaches to traditional narrative in interactive contexts, as well as piloting new narrative constructs developed for non-linear media. Each class meeting is broken up into two parts. The first is a seminar discussion examining an aspect of traditional narrative, and the way it is threatened or rendered obsolete in an interactive context. The second takes the form of workshop exercises and short projects through which alternative narrative forms specifically suited for an interactive environment are conceived, prototyped and evaluated. Students also work on longer-term experiments in interactive narrative, developing rule sets through which emergent narratives may form. These<br />
 may take forms ranging from augmented theater, interactive comics, and video games to robots, installations, software, amusement rides, or prototypes for as-yet undefined media.  Readings will include Aristotle, McKee, Ibsen, Brecht, Marie Ryan, Scott Mcloud, Rushkoff, Carse, Huizinga, Burroughs, and a few current game theorists. <br />

        	The course focus is on the design and creation of digital musical instruments.  Music in performance is the primary subject of this class.  We approach questions such as "What is performance?"  "What makes a musical interface intuitive and emotionally immediate?" and "How do we create meaningful correlations between performance gestures and their musical consequences?"  Over the semester, we look at many examples of current work by creators of musical interfaces, and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology-enabled performance - such as novice versus virtuoso performers, discrete versus continuous data control, the importance of haptic responsiveness as well as the relationship between musical performance and visual display.  Extensive readings and case studies provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance.  Students design and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, algorithm for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself.  A technical framework for prototyping performance controllers is made available.  Students focus on musical composition and improvisation techniques as they prepare their prototypes for live performance.  The class culminates in a musical performance where students (or invited musicians) will demonstrate their instruments.  Prerequisites: H79.2233 (Introduction to Computational Media) and H79.2301 (Physical Computing).	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Artists, designers, inventors and scientist all need to see things that are new—often that no person has ever seen before. Yet our brains are designed to direct our attention to a thin stream of operational tasks. We screen out the shoes of the person across the subway and the leaves on the trees above our heads. We don't pay much attention to the interplay of shadows or consciously hear the soft squeaking of distant doors. In conversations we rarely attend to what goes unsaid, though vital information often lurks in the omissions. The seeds of a brilliant work might lie in detecting a simple gesture. We only need to notice it. This class is a workshop that teaches techniques and tools for noticing—seeing, hearing and comprehending what might otherwise pass us by. In a series of focused classes we explore the observation process in an abundant array of domains, from cognitive psychology to ethnography, drawing to data collection, user research to police work. Projects include sketching, user studies, experimental research, ideation, observational exercises and techniques for reaching that moment we all crave when something unexpected and terrific bursts forward into our consciousness. The class culminates in a final work inspired by one of your brand-new discoveries and honed with the help of the observational techniques and tools learned in class. Students should leave with their eyes and minds opened to the inspirations that surround us all.  <br />

        	This class will use open-source software to solve interesting problems in animation, with a focus on integrating depth, motion-capture, and other kinds of live performance data into traditional film production workflows.  We’ll pay special attention to the Kinect, which (among other things) is the first motion capture system ever sold at Best Buy--but in order to fully realize its promise for our purposes, we’ll have to get it talking to mature commercial animation software like After Effects and Maya.  If the tools we need don’t already exist, then we’ll need to write our own.  The end product of the class will be a complete animated short film and the software tools that help realize it--you can explore anything from pure visual music to narrative character puppetry.  Our initial exercises will use AfterEffects, JavaScript, and Processing, but we can explore many other<br />
options depending on student interests.  It’d be helpful to start the class with either some prior filmmaking or programming experience--but you don’t necessarily need to know anything about 3D CG to do cool stuff with motion capture.		  		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	Recent developments in digital fabrication have shifted the focus from conventional manufacturing processes to a new model based on scripted parametric forms. By modeling objects and structures as generative software processes rather than as static models, it becomes possible to produce highly complex forms for customized on-demand fabrication.  In this course we explore strategies for parametric modeling including generative systems, data-driven form processes and user interaction. The focus is on creating structures that can be manufactured as physical objects using 3D printing, CNC milling laser cutting.  Our main tool is Processing, supported by other CAD tools to aid in preparing models for fabrication.	  	<br />

<br />
Acting for Non-Actors... A practice class in which acting techniques will be used to explore fictional and real performed identities.  Students do not have to have acting experience.  Class will end in a performance for an invited audience.  <br />
<br />
This class is offered out of Performance Studies but is also open to ITP students. The goal is to have at least half of the students be from ITP. Acting techniques will be used to explore fictional and real performed identities.  Students do not have to have acting experience.  Class will end in a performance for an invited audience.  This class will be very useful if you are interested in narrative of any kind--interactive or linear storytelling, games or invented worlds. Be Aware: the class will take place on weekends (saturday or sunday TBD). Each class will be about 4 hours long, so it will only be 9 classes. If you sign on, you are expected to come to every class--that's a commitment. Not easy. But on the other hand: you get a unique experience--to work intensely and deeply with a world-reknowned artist and performer.		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

In subtle and not-so-subtle ways technology is influencing our behavior – from buying more books on Amazon than we intended to, to helping us change bad personal habits to leveraging the voices of many– technology presents an opportunity to be an agent of change. This 2 pt course will explore how technology can be used to influence behavior. We will look at a number of behavioral theories including incentive–based design, gamification and social influence. We will review case studies on how these techniques have been used to effectively affect behavior. <br />
After researching theories on behavior motivation each student will identify a problem or issue that they hope to influence. Students will document the problem, develop a concept to influence the behavior associated with that problem and prototype (or build) their solution. They will test their solution and draw conclusions from the experiment. Projects can attempt to influence social change at a large, social scale or at a personal level. The unifying theme behind the projects will be that they intend to inspire positive change. <br />
<br />
This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester. The goal of the course is to provide students with a sold understanding of the potential technology provides to motivate and affect change in behavior. Students will develop projects that aim to influence behavior.<br />

        	Designing and building physical objects can feel like putting together a puzzle without the box top. Even if you have all the pieces, an extra challenge lies in figuring out how they fit together. Digital fabrication tools make it possible to newly imagine and produce pieces that allow us to recreate or modify the "puzzle" as we see fit. Utilizing historic farm equipment (e.g. windmills, clocks, grain harvesters) as design inspiration, we will explore the possibilities of digital fabrication tools to solve issues of fastening,  synchronicity, replaceable parts, repeatability, and modification of existing designs. A central goal of this class is to come to terms, and work productively, with the limitations of these otherwise revolutionary digital fabrication tools—particularly in regards to materials, scale, and aesthetics. By the end of the semester, students will be familiar with Adobe Illustrator, 2D and 3D CAD software, laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D printing.  No prior fabrication or design background is required for this course.		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

The class will partner with the New York State Poet Laureate Marie Howe to stage a series of poetic interventions in public space in the form of augmented reality, interactive installation and large scale projections. Over the course of the semester, students will work alongside poets to create installations and animations for city streets, subway tunnels and building façades. Students will create three projects, at three different scales, each inspired by a different poem or poet.  Possible projects include animation, mobile applications and text visualization with the final being a one night large scale projection onto a public building in New York City.

        	The relationship between politics and media has always been complex --the rise of newspapers accompanied the rise of democracy; radio and TV have always been tools of propaganda, and so on. This course asks the question "What difference does it make that citizens have access to social media?", which is to say media tools that let them synchronize their opinions, coordinate their actions, and document the results.  Though there will be background readings in the relationship between media and politics (Habermas, Rossanvallon, Galloway), most of the course will focus on discussions of political events of the last decade where the insurgents (and, increasingly, the governments) used social media to attempt to alter the outcome. These will include the ouster of Estrada in the Philippines, the Belarussian 'flash mob' protests, the South Korean 'Mad Cow' protests, the Tea Party, the Arab Spring, and the Occupy movement.  There will be weekly readings on the topic of political uses of social media, and a mid-term and final paper.  You will also work in groups to observe and discuss the operations of a contemporary group seeking political change, and using these tools.	  		  		  		</div></li>

        	In New York City, every storefront window has the possibility to tell a story, spark a conversation or inspire an interaction. This workshop will focus on creating innovative interactive pop up installations designed for public window displays.  A successful window is one that clearly delivers a message directly to the public.  How do we create interactive displays that engage the public with a distinctive voice or style? Over seven weeks, students will concept, prototype and build an interactive experience meant to be installed in a storefront or commercial display. This course will explore lighting, design, and budgeting of durable interactive window installations.   Previous fabrication or programming experience is encouraged. 		<br />

<br />
The class aims not only to teach the students how to create physical prints via code, but also to have something interesting to say about it.<br />
<br />
The class requires ICM or similar programming background.		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	How do games tell stories? Can traditional narratives work well in games? Or is there a more holistic approach that embeds the story deeply into the interaction model? Ian Bogost created a framework for such games - procedural games, or art games. In these games, the  structure itself becomes a storytelling device. How does it feel to live day to day in a situation? What are the play mechanics we use the advance the narrative of our own lives? The goal of the procedural designer is to cause the player to stop and reflect about a given situation during or after play, without concern for resolution or effect. Procedural games share more in common with art house movies than mainstream games and are finely tuned experiences flying in the face of traditional game design. In this class, students will study a range of these kinds of games and be expected to create a reflective game experience by the end of the term. <br />
<br />
Topics Include: Unity, Unity’s 2D toolkit, sprite sheet creation. <br />
Coding Experience: Ideally, students will have taken at least one class in Processing or Open Frameworks. We will learn c# within the Unity engine to create our games. If you have a basic understanding of programming in any language, including javascript, you are also welcome. 		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	In this class, students will question the meaning and values that inform existing consumer products and examine the ways users perceive them, interact with them, and assimilate them into their daily lives. The class emphasizes ethnographic research, conceptual and technical exploration, and interaction programming. Using methods of direct and indirect communication between object and user, students will deliver a new layer of meaning or value to a specific consumer object of their choice.<br />
The objective of the class is to consider the following:<br />
-Why do I need a new product?<br />
-What does it mean to me?<br />
- What type of value does it bring to the world?<br />
The class is a design-oriented, hands-on creative program. Participating students will work on one theme over the course of the semester and are expected to produce an interactive prototype of their concept by semester's end. The final deliverable should demonstrate the physical and digital aspects of the user experience.<br />
There are two aspects to the class, one is to form a conceptual story around the experience, and the other is technical implementation to deliver the experience. Quick and rough iterative prototyping is encouraged to help inform concept ideation and possible design decisions from early stage of the class.<br />
The process of the class is divided into three stages:<br />
1. User study and research<br />
2. Design concept ideation<br />
3. Implementation and refinement<br />
The class instructors will support and lead the students by introducing industrial design methodology, rapid interaction prototyping techniques and examples from their professional practice while encouraging exploratory creative freedom.		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Digital audio has a vast array of possibilities far beyond music playback.  Data sonification reinforces visualization. Processing sound can give you data like a sensor.  Foley sounds to make a video sound alive. A soundtrack generated from the same data as the video tightly links the two.  Extract data from music and make algorithmic responses. Realtime digital audio processing lets you synthesize a huge array of sounds, create your own sampler, and build your own musical instrument.  All completely open ended, you define how it works.  Sound provides an alternate channel of communication to other sense, with its own strengths and weaknesses.  Humans are able to hear minute differences in time, its the most time sensitive sense. Huge amounts of audio processing happen in the background of our brains, we will hear our name mentioned in a crowded room with no effort. This class will introduce how sound works in the computer, our brain, and the physical world. In parallel, it will introduce how to shape, analyze and control sound.  The aim is to provide a basic knowledge of principles and practices of digital audio from a creative perspective. While digital audio involves heavy math, this course presents a working knowledge over the normal detailed math approach to digital signal processing for audio. Pd has its roots in realtime audio programming and that is the core of the class.  You will end up with a launching point for further learning, especially in interactive, non-narrative sound. The final project is an interactive or generated piece that uses or makes sound.  This course uses Pd, but much of this knowledge is applicable to Max/MSP as well. The prerequisite for this 2 point course, which meets the second seven weeks of the semester, is the two-point course "Intro to Dataflow Programming", which meets in the first seven weeks, (or equivalent experience).  This two-point course meets for the second seven weeks of the semester. 		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

It is basically like an independent study with more structure and the opportunity for peer learning.  This particular studio is appropriate for projects in the area of interactive art, programing,  physical computing and digital fabrication. There are required weekly meetings to share project development and obtain critique.  Students must devise and then complete their own weekly assignments updating the class wiki regularly.  They also must present to the class every few weeks.  When topics of general interest emerge, a member of the class or the instructor takes class time to cover them in depth.

        	Spacebrew is an open-source tool for building and experimenting with interactive spaces. It facilitates rapid prototyping of interactive and responsive environments by enabling designers and developers to easily and quickly connect real-time interactive applications across microcontrollers, computers and the cloud.<br />
<br />
This workshop will introduce Spacebrew from a technical perspective and explore ways to prototype large scale interactive installations with Spacebrew. On the technical side, we will cover: a high-level introduction to Spacebrew; an overview of how to connect to Spacebrew with Processing, openFrameworks, Arduino, and Javascript; and demonstrations on how to use Spacebrew to connect all of the above together. Students will then be split into small groups and will be tasked with creating prototypes around a specific interactive scenario. Finally, we will explore narratives that can be created when these individual prototypes are networked together. <br />

        	While grocery shopping, have you ever wanted to talk to a cucumber? Make out with a red radish or pet a pizza? You can. Following the idea that puppets are "any performing object" and that objects can be useful as stand-ins for human beings, this class explores anthropomorphism, character development, narrative and performance. Through weekly assignments and a final project, we will bring life to objects that we create, transform or find. Drawing inspiration from different styles of mainstream and experimental art, entertainment and puppetry we will develop original concepts of our own. Exercises explore a range of technologies and materials, from simple sock puppets to body puppets, mechanisms, robots and animatronics. We’ll spend time looking at how to successfully integrate interactive elements from other realms such as music, SFX, physical interfaces, etc. into our performances. This is a hands on class. Performance or puppetry skills are not required. You must bring your imagination and willingness to experiment and come up with creative solutions to class assignments. At the end of the semester students will showcase their best work and put on a crazy show!		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This course introduces the Python programming language as a tool for reading and writing digital text. This course is specifically geared to serve as a general-purpose introduction to programming in Python, but will be of special interest to students interested in poetics, language, creative writing and text analysis. Weekly programming exercises work toward a midterm project and culminate in a final project. Poetics topics covered include: character encodings (and other technical issues); cut-up and re-mixed texts; the algorithmic nature of poetic form (proposing poetic forms, generating text that conforms to poetic forms); transcoding/transcription (from/to text); generative algorithms: n-gram analysis, context-free grammars; performing digital writing. Programming topics covered include: object-oriented programming; functional programming (list comprehensions, recursion); getting data from the web; displaying data on the web; parsing data formats (e.g., markup languages); and text visualization with Processing.  Prerequisites: Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience.	  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	As a response to developing technologies, artists working in areas of new/digital media are continually inventing new concepts for self-expression - interactivity, the passage of time and resolution, just to name a few. Yet these concepts are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, the notion of interactivity, frequently observed as original and specific to the user-interaction component of computer-mediated works, was equally, if differently, specific to Gianlorenzo Bernini's 17th-century Baroque sculpture and architecture.  Indeed the very concept of new media, and the concomitant implication of critically significant artistic development, applies throughout history.  Oil revolutionized painting in the Renaissance, as did house-paint (on canvas) in the 1950s; in the 1910s, the found object indelibly altered definitions of art, the importance of the object being subsumed by that of the concept in the 1960s.  This course examines how artists working before the boom of digital technology utilized other media, techniques and approaches to effect formal, conceptual and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The objective of the course is to provide students with not only knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also a platform through which that knowledge might be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. It is the goal that through observation, discussion, reading and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility.  Organized thematically, each class focuses on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents.  The course focus primarily, though not exclusively, is on 20th/21st-century art.  It is conducted as a combination lecture/discussion class.   Critical theory is incorporated into the readings and discussions, but this is not strictly a theory course.  The course has been conceptualized and designed to enhance understanding through a variety of means, from basic observation, to exploratory conversations, to more rigorous thinking informed by lectures, readings and focused discussions.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	New technologies such as Voice over IP, and open source telephony applications such as Asterisk, have opened the door for the development of interactive applications that use telephony for its traditional purpose -- voice communications.  This course explores the use of the telephone in interactive art, performance, social networking, and multimedia applications.  Asterisk and low cost VoIP service are used to develop applications that can work over both telephone networks and the internet.  Topics include: history of telephony, plain old telephone service (POTS), voice over IP (VoIP), interactive voice response systems (IVR), audio user interfaces, voice messaging systems (voicemail), text to speech, phreaking (telephone hacking), VoIP to Web integration, conferencing and more.  In addition to interactive telephony, the class will also cover basic Linux commands and Linux sys-admin.  This course will primarily use Ruby for scripting, but students who are comfortable with another scripting language like PHP, JavaScript/Node.js, or Perl may opt to use those languages instead.  No prior knowledge of Ruby is required, although all students should be comfortable with tackling new and unique programming challenges.		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	"Nature" is a construct that needs to be reexamined.  Making work about "nature" can take place anywhere; the entire world is "natural," while none of it is.<br />
<br />
"Nature" contains animals, plants, weather, people, airplanes, computers, microbes, stars, asphalt, and even unicorns and fairies - the agents that comprise our world-view.<br />
<br />
This course combines public art interventions with urban nature, making new poetics about the natural world and our place within it. We will use the NYU area as our field study station, and make guerilla (unsanctioned) public art experiments that challenge the dominant assertions about "nature." <br />
<br />
In the past 25 years, much has been written to contest Enlightenment Era (and Romantic) ideals about the nature/culture divide, and about humans' separation from the rest of the natural world.  While both Hallmark cards-style sentimentalism and extreme environmentalists  preserve the human/nature divide, ample multi-disciplinary work is being done to propose a different set of relations between humans and the earth at every level. We see the demonstration of a complex mix of non-human and human agency at work in ecology, popular journalism, art, poetry, and in academia – including science studies, animal studies, and even medieval studies.<br />
<br />
"Renatured" takes this idea as an organizing construct: <br />
"Life," the theoretical biologist Lynn Margulis wrote in 1995, "is a network of cross-kingdom alliances."<br />
<br />
The first part of the course covers new writings in ecology, science studies, vibrant matter, and ecocriticism and a new look at artistic strategies to address "nature;" followed by two areas of focus, each with a public project:<br />
Interagents: humans, plants, fungi, and non-human animals<br />
Interagents: humans and the climate.<br />
 <br />
This is a studio class in critical creativity. Technologies are up to the students' discretion, but might include computers, paper, or dirt.<br />
<br />
Selected readings include Epicurus, Bruno Latour, Timothy Morton, Jane Bennett, Kate Soper<br />
<br />
Subject matter will include invasive species, nonhuman sentience, machine wilderness, DIY and guerilla actions, and interspecies relations<br />

        	In this research-based studio class students will choose an advanced computational topic to explore in depth. Work will be self-directed and monitored by weekly writing and bi-weekly class presentations with extensive feedback sessions. Students will be expected to exhibit a high degree of motivation in choosing and pursuing their research topic. Students will choose a narrowly defined topic within their chosen subject area to research in depth, implementing examples in code, explaining the fundamentals in class and summarizing relevant research papers.<br />
<br />
Sample research topics include:<br />
"the use of Hopfield neural networks for image recognition"<br />
"evolving self organized maps"<br />
"simulating realistic plantlike growth"<br />
"the use of grammar in machine generated text". <br />
<br />
Students will begin by preparing a broad survey and literature review of their chosen subject. They will then craft plans for how to accomplish specific goals in the semester timeframe, culminating in final project presentations which will include implementations in code for demonstration.  This class is platform independent but requires advanced knowledge of one or more programming languages. Students should come to the first day of class with a research topic in mind. Research topics may or may not be tied to specific student projects like thesis. <br />

        	We build computers around an illusory image of ourselves.  In particular the illusion that our consciousness is the full extent of our experience limits how we might use computers to augment the fuller expression of our lives.  This class looks at how we can use computational media to connect with the rest of your existence. The class begins by examining some of the illusions that we operate under and how revisiting those can be helpful.  Then we will use sensors to give voice the less represented parts of your body.  This class will also serve as a gentle rejoinder to Physical Computing and ICM.  Exercises will use bio sensors, cameras, logging, mobile tech, data analysis and visualization.		  		  		  <br />

Using smart phones, low-cost open source hardware and crowdsourcing software, citizens can now make real contributions to cutting-edge urban science projects in a wide range of fields. <br />
<br />
Specifically, the course introduces Crowdcrafting as an open source tool for rapid prototyping of citizen data gathering and analysis, and explores ways to combine this with various sensors and phone apps. Students will study and critique existing urban science projects, design their own project and use Crowdcrafting to implement it.<br />
<br />
The course will feature a number of guest speakers on the theme of 'urban science meets citizen science' such as tracking where New York trash goes, measuring air and noise pollution, classifying the city's trees and studying the genetic makeup of bugs in the sewers.<br />
<br />
This course is in collaboration with CUSP, NYU's new Centre for Urban Science and Progress. <br />

        	This course challenges students to combine Processing, Rhino 3D modeling and digital fabrication towards making an everyday data object. Some examples of everyday data objects might include: an ashtray shaped from lung-cancer statistics, a drinking glass based on clean water depletion, a lipstick case showing the growing number of women in parliament. While the first half of the course will focus on creating 3D data visualizations in Processing and Rhino 3D modeling, the second half will concentrate on integrating Processing and Rhino, as well as fabrication using the laser-cutter and 3D printer. 		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This is a class is about creating smart habitats for city dwellers. Students will conceive and prototype large scale device networks to benefit the tenants of a 28-story, 325-unit landmark apartment building on Central Park South in Manhattan. The high-rise owners have once again invited ITP to develop a variety of prototypes that enhance the livability, ecology and community of their apartment building. The class has been newly restructured into three parts: We'll start by touring the building to learn about its infrastructure, inhabitants and context. This begins our Observation and Design phase in which students will employ behavioral studies, user-centered design and ethnography; paired with tenant interviews and other techniques that inspire first-rate innovations. Next we will quickly cover deploying Wireless Technology to connect interactive devices. Finally, we’ll return to the site with prototypes that explore project possibilities, installing these proof-of-concepts and observing the real-world results. We'll take what we’ve learned into Final Projects that have the potential to be deployed at scale and considered for long-term sponsorship.  This 1939 building’s recent renovation created lower-level green roofs, various upgrades for energy efficiency and a historically restored facade. It has been described as, “state-of-the-art green architecture before the term was coined." The building’s motto is “Where The Park is Part of the Plan.” Our class is provided with access to unoccupied units, and opportunities to connect with current residents. The owners generously allow full supervised access to building infrastructure from roof to basement including ventilation, plumbing, heating, elevator and energy systems. Students get an extraordinary chance to invent and deliver big benefits for residents using active observation techniques as they develop interactive networks on a towering scale.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Good physical interaction design relies on listening to physical action well.  In this class, students will focus on the input side of physical computing by researching various sensors and sensing methods and developing examples for their use.  Conceptually, this class sits in between the physical interaction design focus of Intro to Physical Computing,  and the electronics focus of Analog Circuits. <br />
<p><br />
 Topics include:<br />
<ul><br />
<li> how to interface sensors to digital systems<br />
<li> calibration<br />
<li> how to convert the electrical output of a sensor into the terms of the energy it senses<br />
<li> computational techniques for interpreting a sensor's datastream<br />
<li> datalogging techniques<br />
<li> environmental sensing<br />
</ul><br />
<br />
The class will assemble a library of sensor applications for interactive applications, and apply this research to applications in their classes at ITP.<br />
<p><br />
There will be a number of one-week exercises that students will complete to demonstrate sensor techniques discussed in class.  In addition, students will be responsible for a major sensor research project in which they will explain the operating principles of a given sensor and present a working example of the sensor in use. These research projects will be  presented throughout the second half of the semester, and collected into an online reference site.  There is no final application project, but students will be evaluated on the application of their research (or that of other students) in production projects developed for other classes.<p>	  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Site suggests contexts that are spatial, temporal, narrative, and populated. Site-specific works require a frame for participants, a set of stories and a point of entry. More than art within "the framework" of an art institution, site-specific, interactive and community-based works require rigorous levels of observation, interrogation, and participation. Whether in the physical or the virtual public, frame and context are primary considerations in the work you produce.  This class is part studio and part refection, using contemporary art examples and writings that engage and critique the local and the global, invert locale and  involve the everyday as well as traditional urban studies of observation. The studio portion of the class will either utilize an existent space in New York, or work towards the development of proposals for a fictional grant for lower Manhattan.		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Proteins are poetry<br />
Atoms are art<br />
If you didn't know that<br />
Here's where to start<br />
<br />
This course aims to introduce the aesthetics of the nano-world as revealed by scanning probe microscopes. These instruments are used to study and manipulate objects on the atomic and molecular scale. They do not "see" objects using photons, like their optical microscope cousins, but rather "feel" them, with exquisitely sensitive nanoscale probes. This works in much the same way that an old-fashioned gramophone needle senses a vinyl disc. This form of microscopy was invented in the 1980s, and catalyzed the booming field of nanotechnology. A specific hands-on goal of this project is for students to work alongside scientists to record scanning probe microscope images and share them on the internet, so that citizen scientists can enjoy the beauty of the nano-world as well as help analyze scientific data. An example of the sort of practical outcome the course aims at is the project <a href="http://pybossa.com/app/feynmanflowers">Feynman's Flowers.</a><br />
<br />
An underlying objective of the course is to help promote within nanotechnology the same spirit of "open science" that has enabled astronomers to engage the public in the analysis of all sorts of telescope imagery, from measuring craters on Mars to classifying images of distant galaxies.

        	In this course students will brainstorm, prototype and deploy DIY technologies and systems to support urban farming, permaculture and community gardening with a special focus on soil. Typically agricultural technologies are proprietary and expensive. How can do-it-yourself approaches and electronic hacks provide urban farmers and community gardeners access to similar tools at lower costs? <br />
<br />
Soil is a neglected resource in our cities. Paved over, compacted and contaminated, urban soil is rendered nonconductive and even life threatening. It is no longer a conduit for life but rather a dead end. With the rise of urban farming and the local food movement, as well as extreme weather events in the age of climate change, reevaluating our relationship to soil has become urgent. In this course we will remake urban soil as a productive medium, teeming with billions of microbes and rich in healing potential. Towards this end, we will work with worms, microscopes, decomposing matter and inocula. This exploration will take us out of the classroom and into sites like a soil lab, urban farm, food rescue center, nutritionist's office, former landfill and river bank to understand the systems at work in the broader soil food web. The projects in this class will take form as proposals and prototypes that promote soil rehabilitation and fertility within urban centers. Students will have the opportunity to deploy select prototypes in a NYC community garden to test efficacy over the longer term.	<br />

        	Spatial Media explores both the design and technical issues involved in the creation of interac- tive spaces. Students will examine several specific spaces as sets of interactions and reactions (inputs/output) that can be molded, enhanced, and subverted to create focused narratives. The class will be built around an iterative design process, with an emphasis on building and docu- menting technical and nontechnical prototypes. Technical topics include vision-based sensing systems, display integration techniques, and interactive graphics programming. Students work in groups to complete two large projects over the course of the semester. Projects are evaluated on both the quality of the design and the success of implementation. Additionally, there are weekly assignments that challenge students to consider a wide variety of spaces that are ripe for transformation through the integration of interactive media. Since this class involves pro- gramming on an intermediate level, a working knowledge of Processing or C is a prerequisite.		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	The loss of privacy is a fact of modern life.  Technology, specifically surveillance technology, now both powerful and ubiquitous is partially responsible.  We are surrounded by networked surveillance cameras, small or easily concealed recording devices are easily obtained, even our own mobile phones and desktop computers can be used to watch and track our behavior or even unwittingly capture our images. <br />
<br />
In this course, along with students from Tisch’s Grad Film department, we’ll explore surveillance tools in the context of documentary film production.  Surveillance and the technology of surveillance will be explored as both the topic of documentaries produced as well as the means of production.<br />
<br />
This course will be co-taught by ITP faculty member Shawn Van Every and Carol Dysinger from Grad Film.  Enrollment will be limited to 8 students from each department working together in pairs or small teams.  It will run on a modified schedule meeting from 12:30 to 3:25 (2 hours and 55 minutes) at ITP for 12 weeks during the semester.  Specifically, it will meet on weeks 1 through 9 and 12 through 14 with a “production break” during week’s 10 and 11.  (The “production break” is when the Grad Film students go into production on their directing class assignments and may be when the filming for this class will occur as well.)		  		  		  		  		  		</div></li>

        	We communicate with fabric every day. Our choice of clothing speaks volumes about our identities. An upholstered chair invites different interaction than an uncushioned seat. And carrying a reusable canvas bag has become both an environmental and a fashion statement. The technology of creating textiles entered human culture so early that we often use it for important metaphors. We weave tales to create our social fabric. This seven week course will explore the history of textiles and the possibilities of communication through the medium of fabric. Basic sewing will be covered along with techniques on integrating synthetic materials and circuits to commonly found fabric. Prerequisites: Physical Computing and Comm Lab 2D design.<br />

We will cover embedding electronics in paper projects like books, pop-ups, and sculptures. We'll explore several soft circuits techniques for integrating electronics in textile creations. And we'll play with our food, giving it unusual properties such as touch sensing and illumination. All the while approaching circuitry as a craft in itself and using smart materials, electronics and conductive traces as aesthetic components.<br />
<br />
Topics and techniques covered in this course include: laying out circuits on paper or fabric, handling folds and bends, making connections between hardware and other softer components, painting circuits with conductive ink, using mundane materials as tech components, adding illumination to delicate constructions, and using fruits, vegetables and drinks as sensors. And we'll work with a vast assortment of materials such as electrotextiles, different conductive tapes, EL wire/tape/panels, UV and heat reactive materials, conductive acetate, heating elements, luminescent materials, and conductive paints and glues.		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

As a creative and technical medium, computer graphics draws upon the rich legacies of the visual arts and cinema, but can also be seen as an emerging artistic medium with its own unique properties and possibilities.<br />
Topics include: Drawing primitives, complex geometries and point clouds; transformations and matrices; perspective and orthographic cameras; textures and lighting; GPU optimizations and GLSL shaders.<br />
<br />
Matching code samples will be provided in Processing, OpenFrameworks and Cinder. The course will be taught primarily in Processing, with C++ support during office hours.<br />

        	What’s between Leonardo Da Vinci and code? In this seminar-studio course we tap into the polymath mind of the genius artist-engineer. His 7000 pages organized in codices serve as a creative framework for surveying contemporary digital art. We will built the syllabus collaboratively mining topics from Da Vinci's notebooks. We’ll compare the universe Da Vinci lived in with the universe we live in to consider a deeper insight into how the technologies we develop change how we know and experience the world.  As an "unlearnt” man, Da Vinci’s ravenous interests grew out of methods of observation, experimentation and invention. As we review digital art practices in the areas of his study and inventions warfare, flight, anatomy, robotic, geometry, architecture, painting and more, we will focus on exercising our own capacity to invent. Every week we will conceive a new object or approach, from the practical to the outrageous. These inventions will be drawn in the style of Da Vinci’s manuscripts. 		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	We live among the vast and relatively unknown Kingdom of Fungi. Mycelial networks have been likened to social and communications networks. What do we have in common with mushrooms? What can we learn from them? Fungi communicate, remediate, and decompose. They are used as food, medicine, spiritual guides, and material building blocks. Some are crucial to the soil food web; others will kill you. Fungi are closer to Animalia than to Plantae, and only 5% of the Fungi have been classified. <br />
<br />
Students will explore fungi through reading, writing and interacting with fungi, and making two projects that explore the physical and conceptual material covered in class. Readings that span the biological, theoretical, social and creative will include Paul Stamets, Dale Pendell, Anna Tsing, and Gilles Deleuze. No technical skills are covered in this class, however students are asked to utilize "technologies" in the creation of projects, which might include digital media, cooking, mycotecture, or working with existent fungal communities.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  <br />

        	Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems.  We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems.  Subjects covered include physics simulation, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms.   Examples are demonstrated using the Processing (<a href="http://www.processing.org">http://www.processing.org</a>) environment with a focus on  object oriented programming.   We will also look at how to implement the examples in native JavaScript using a new framework <a href="https://github.com/lmccart/processing-js">p5.js</a>.

        	The Quantified Self on Location: As our devices have shrunk in size and grown in computational capacity, we've seen an explosion of technology meant to enhance our lives through bio-metric and geo-located data. Anticipation around the combination of these data is high, especially as companies like Apple and Google start developing wearable hardware. In this class, we'll prototype devices that combine bio-sensors and GPS, and we'll examine the implications of aggregating and analyzing this data for the individual, the community, the city, and beyond.		  		  		  		  <br />

        	 If your artistic practice is a hybrid and based on something “out in the world,” you will want to imaginatively synthesize research, whether you work with neuroscience, surveillance, war strategies, fungi, or musical notation systems.  Cultivating a “Research-based Practice” requires an artist/designer to be a pioneer, a detective and a psychic all in one. You have to meet not only allies but also with the “opposition,” and enlist the aid of experts and supporters who might find your practice “strange.” Before you find your POV, you have to take on many perspectives.<br />
<br />
What does it look like to make work in, through and as research? How do you follow a hunch? Engage experts and passersby to explore both legitimate AND preposterous leads? Be expansive? How do you leave your own trail of documentation that can contribute to a body of knowledge beyond the products of your own art? These forms of research may mix a variety of scientific and intuitive methods. The artist/designer is free to employ speculation, open-endedness, and irony; to use design as a way to probe or even provoke the chosen fields of inquiry. <br />
<br />
There isn’t a protocol for art and design expressions, so you have make your own.<br />
<br />
The class is devoted to the question of how to initiate and investigate research and incorporate it intelligently and sensitively into your work. This class is about developing your own idiosyncratic and well-documented means of pulling threads, following leads, and becoming fearless about asking for help and others’ expertise. You become a temporary expert.<br />
<br />
Through hands-on practice, case studies, guest speakers from both art and science, and readings on ethnography, research, and the idea of a public, we will explore method, documentation and presentation of your research, and the merits of both success and failure.<br />
<br />
Student work is divided into two 3-week research areas and one final 6-week research project. All  topics will have historical, technological and social components to explore.  Research includes ethnography, interviews, published papers, media, video, drawing, visiting archives, and at least three face-to-face meetings with strangers for each of the assignments. We will look at artist and designers whose work is based on research, and ones whose work IS the research (art in the form of lecture, field notes, tours, experiments, etc).<br />

        	This course is designed to help students define and execute their final thesis project in a setting that is both collegial and critical.  It is structured as a series of critique and presentation sessions in which various aspects of individual projects are discussed:  the project concept, the elaboration, the presentation, the process and time-table, the resources needed to accomplish it, and the documentation.  Critique sessions are e a combination of internal sessions (i.e., the class only) and reviews by external guest critics.  Students are expected to complete a fully articulated thesis project description and related documentation.  Final project prototypes are displayed both on the web and in a public showcase either in May or the following semester.<br />

        	In this one point course we will learn how the GSM network works and will explore cellphone technologies and how to get your projects communicating with a cell carrier. This workshop will take place over three sessions. The first session will be dedicated to learning about the current GSM infrastructure and how the communication between cell phones and the network happens; we will be introducing open source alternatives, both hardware and software, for setting up and deploying you own GSM network as a way to better understand the different components of the system. The second session will focus on getting a hands on experience with off the shelf GSM modules, modems and mobile hardware and getting those devices to communicate with cellphone networks via text message (SMS) and via data transfer (GPRS). The last session will be an open workshop for further developing your mini-project and presenting it to the rest of the class.		  		  		  		  		  <br />

        	Interactive technologies seldom stand alone. They exist in networks, and they facilitate networked connections between people.  Designing technologies for communications requires an  understanding of networks. This course is a foundation in how  networks work. Through weekly readings and class discussions and  a series of short hands-on projects, students gain an  understanding of network topologies, how the elements of a  network are connected and addressed, what protocols hold them  together, and what dynamics arise in networked environments.    This class is intended to supplement the many network-centric  classes at ITP.  It is broad survey, both of contemporary  thinking about networks, and of current technologies and methods  used in creating them.  Prerequisites: Students should have an understanding of basic  programming (Intro to Computational Media or equivalent).   Familiarity with physical computing (Intro to Physical Computing  or equivalent) is helpful, but not essential. Some, though not  all, production work in the class requires programming and  possibly physical and electronic construction. There is a significant reading component to this class as well.<br />
<br />
Possible topics include:<br />
<br />
* topologies: how to think about them (nodes and links), how few  workable ones there are, and how there's no topology so stupid it  isn't in use some place.<br />
* addressing and routing: what a namespace is, three ways to  generate a name (nesting, serial uniqueness, random pseudo- uniqueness), the difference between smart and dumb networks, why  the phone network and the internet differ even though they use  the same wires<br />
* protocols: envelopes and contents, the stack and the reference  lie, end-to-end principles, reliability vs. speed tradeoffs<br />
* scale: more is different, scale breaks otherwise workable  systems, makes redundancy and degeneracy critical, tends to push  systems<br />
* a discussion of security and its effects<br />
<br />
Possible exercises include:<br />
* Basic socket communication, both software and embedded hardware  versions<br />
* Client-server programming<br />
* A group protocol/messaging exercise<br />
* An HTTP/RESTian model exercise 		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	This class will focus on how to create interfaces that get people to take the action you intended them to take and how to make that interaction a compelling experience.  We will look at a wide range of examples of interaction design and explore different approaches to solving user experience problems across a number of platforms and at a wide range of scales. The class format will include lecture, student presentations, class discussion in-class design exercises and some guest lectures. The class will be very hands-on with assignments each week that focus on a particular aspect of user experience design including research, wire-framing, prototyping, critique and user testing. Tools will include pen and paper, BalsamIQ, Proto.io and Omnigraffle. Students will be active participants in the class and all assignments will be discussed and reviewed in class. Students should come to every class with a computer and sketchbook.  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	In 1967 the Sony Portapak became the first portable video system available to the public. Suddenly motion pictures became accessible to artists, experimenters and social activists, not simply Hollywood production companies. The introduction of the Portapak had a great influence not only on the development of ITP but also on the way we create, consume and distribute media today.   How do we create video that is non-linear yet compelling, interactive yet engaging? The goal of this class is to provide an overview of both the history of video, and its relevance to present day new media. Topics covered include aesthetics and concepts, camera usage, editing,  lighting, as well as an introduction to interactive video software such as Jitter and Isadora. Through a series of weekly experiments and assignments, students gain experience with video blogging, short format documentary style, post linear narrative, interactive video installations as well as theatrical video design.  Previous video experience is not required and experimentation is highly encouraged! 	  	<br />

        	Whether shot with an iphone and pieced together through a $.99 app or filmed on a Canon 5D DSLR and meticulously arranged through high-end editing software, video of all shapes and sizes exist throughout the web. Given the accessibility of tools, how do we create video that is non-linear yet compelling, interactive yet engaging? The goal of this class is to introduce students to the fundamentals of video production and storytelling through the context of short form content intended for the web. Specific genres covered will include trailers, promos, educational videos, documentaries, journalistic pieces, and web series. In the first three weeks of the class, students will learn the basics of both audio and video recording using a variety of cameras and audio recorders. Specific topics covered will include scripts and storyboards, camera usage, editing, lighting, and sound. Students will develop, produce, and finish 3 separate short form pieces of content based on conceptual prompts and technical constraints. The second half of the class will focus specifically on interactive applications of video on the web. A variety of use cases will be covered and students will be encouraged to concept and develop their own final web-based video project. Some web development will be covered but this is not a web development course. Guest speakers from companies/organizations including HBO, Vimeo, and the Boston Globe will join us to share first-hand industry experiences. Overall, course work will include reading assignments and 4 short-form video projects. No prior technical skills are required. 	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	Video is the new marble. In this class we breathe new life into video as a medium for creating engaging interactive physical sculpture. Video is no longer a flat screen based medium. How do we create video sculptures that move, emote and react to our presence? The course takes video off the screen and into the world of three-dimensional space in the form of site-specific and or physical installations. Through a series of weekly experiments and assignments, students work with projection, tiny LCD screens, physical sensors and interactive software to hack video into interactive sculptures in the tradition of Nam Jun Paik, Tony Oursler and Camille Utterback. Class is divided between lectures, guest speakers and critical discussion/presentation of work. Previous knowledge of video production / editing is not required, but a mad scientist-like lust to bring video to life is highly encouraged. 	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	JavaScript is increasingly used to generate visuals in the browser and beyond—and it has some very interesting, but often misunderstood properties. How is prototypal inheritance different than classical inheritance? What's more object-oriented, Java or JavaScript? How can we build visuals that take advantage of lambdas and code-as-data? Our course will focus on three things: 1. JavaScript's unique and exciting properties, 2. Generating visuals (both printed and screen-based / animated) using contemporary JS and HTML5 frameworks (like Paper.js, Scriptographer, Three.js, ProtoViz, etc.), and 3. Design as critical visual thinking—rather than simply a veneer. Assignments will range from thought experiments, to printed posters, to interactive animations. Guest critics from both code and design backgrounds will frequently drop by to challenge and inspire students.			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

        	We are living in a world that has not fully absorbed the societal and individual implications of networks and new technologies, but is already saturated with the vernacular implementations of these things. These seminars will focus on examples of these technologies and their effects, and on how we may group and communicate them, using the example of the New Aesthetic, a project of recognition and classification. In this class students will explore the many variations of technologically mediated and co-produced artworks, artefacts and experiences, and build individual practices of categorisation and communication. The goal of the course is to enable and advance critical thinking around new technologies in all their manifestations, and develop the tools of practice, visualisation and communication required to perform this thinking. Students will be expected to develop their own methods of communicating this experience in the form of their choice, through writing, speaking, making or curation, with a view to informing their own work in the future.  		</div></li>

        	Even the simplest exchange among strangers can contain a tangled accumulation of meanings: what transpires may have physical, emotional, social, political, technological and historical dimensions. This class takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP—urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience—and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas.  Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students will document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers 'read' each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs. We also explore recent art/technology projects that specifically engage strangers, such as Familiar Strangers, the Listening Station, PostSecret, Oddible, Loca: Set to Discoverable, Following/the Man in the Crowd, Mobile Feelings, and others.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

For zoologists, anthropologists, and veterinary researchers, understanding the technologies behind their tracking equipment, and the methods that technology designers use to develop these tools can benefit their research.<br />

The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to the technological challenges associated with observing and tracking wildlife in remote environments. As a focal case study, students are presented with the practical problems faced by professorAnthony Di Fiore's primate research group, which is involved in studying several nonhuman primate species in the Amazon region of Ecuador. Students will discuss the research group's workflow, survey the state of the art in animal tracking, and work in groups to develop interactive prototypes to address one or more specific challenges facing tropical wildlife biologists.<br />
<p><br />
In order to realize the goals of this class, students will be introduced to current tracking tools and remote observation tools, including radiocollars, camera traps, GPS receivers and other emerging technologies. This semester, we will place a greater focus on radio communications and tracking technologies and on understanding mapping technologies, to help focus projects on tracking applications. This class is part introduction and part interaction design lab with real-world end users. The goal is not only to understand the challenges, but to help develop solutions that could be used in the field in Ecuador and other places.		  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
